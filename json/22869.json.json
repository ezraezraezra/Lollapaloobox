Several years of performing with the Jack &amp; Jill Players paid off in commercials and finally a featured role in a made for TV movie with Morgan Freeman and Cicely Tyson. Moving on to high school and later college and grad school, she left her theater days behind her to become a science geek.\n<br><br>\nRandomly playing records at a popular shoe store one day, party promoters du jour, Pure, saw Lady D's raw talent and began to book her at shows.  While honing her skills, she was playing alongside such acts as Sandra Collins, Paul Johnson, Danny the Wildchild and more, and holding her own.\n<br><br> \nAfter a few years of playing she was approached by hard house label UC Music to help establish their new underground house label, Afterhours, where she quickly moved up the ranks from retail and DJ promotions to A &amp; R and Label Manager. In that capacity, she signed Kaskade’s first release as well as added productions from Derrick Carter, Miguel Migs, &amp; Full Intention to the Afterhours catalog.\n<br><br>\nAt this time she began to collaborate with gold record artist Ron Carroll with poetry and spoken word. Spending a lot more time in the studio, Lady D got the itch to make music and called on Glenn Underground to mentor her as a producer.  That was the impetus behind her first release, “Champagne Lady”, that appeared on Afterhours’ Sessions Vol. 2 compiled by Mazi (Audio Soul Project).\n<br><br>\nBeginning to travel more intensely by this time, Lady D gathered many inspirations from the club scene and worked with artists such as Common Factor, Demarkus Lewis and continued her creative work with Ron Carroll.  In 2004 she started her own label, D’lectable, and has enjoyed bringing eclectic house selections from DJ Sneak, Jamie Principle, Mark Grant, E Smoove and more, to the world ever since.\n<br><br>\nLady D's production catalog includes releases on Open Bar NYC and her own label, D’lectable, as well as a number of vocal credits.  She and producer Max Loomis produce together under the alias \"Joint Effort\" and her vocal tracks have been remixed by a number of well-known folks including Felix Da Housecat, Djinxx and Mark Simmons.

Lady D also stars in the documentary Slip Cue Movie, which was shown at this year's Cannes Film Festival Short Film Corner. This year, she'll be featured at The Wanderlust Festival (July 19) and Lollapalooza’s 20th Anniversary (August 5-7) on Perry’s stage.

He’s become the most buzz-worthy current Reggae artist over the past few years. In the summer, 2007, Collie Buddz’ Columbia Records self-titled debut album stormed the charts entering the Billboard Reggae Chart at first position. The Reggae singjay became an international star when this album then went on to debut across the world at the top of every chart from Japan to Germany. With much of the production coming from Collie himself, he delivered a solid debut with contributions from Supa Dups, Shea Taylor, Bang Out, Screwface, Bobby Konders and Crown N Kah-So-Real to name just a few. Released just a day before US Independence Day, Collie’s debut album could be heard blasting out of car windows from Brooklyn to Kingston all summer long. Critically speaking, Collie’s debut was a monster. Speaking of his first single, an undeniable summer anthem titled, “Come Around,” Source Magazine proclaimed, “This 24 year old shotta has got an anthem spreading across the seas.” “The song is a monster,” claimed Miami New Times. And, Hip Hop Weekly said, “Collie Buddz is one of the most firmly grounded voices you may ever encounter.” The industry excitement about this new voice in music manifested in many ways namely by inspiring Collie’s musical peers to either create their own remixes of “Come Around,” or join Collie on the official remix of the single. Everyone from Busta Rhymes, Cypress Hill and Paul Wall to G-Unit and Shaggy contributed to the anthem.\n<br><br>\nIncorporating influences from Hip-Hop to Soca, Collie’s music nevertheless has a rock-solid foundation in Reggae - and its power to connect ghetto reality with the highest heights of human aspiration - that is a rarity even in Jamaica. But, to say he’s connected to the Caribbean community would be an understatement. Collie Buddz, born Colin Harper, has become the Caribbean culture’s resident ambassador.\n<br><br>\nTouring extensively, Collie’s passport stamps are a relative reflection of the worldwide love for Reggae and Caribbean culture. From Madison Square Garden to Dubai, Collie Buddz is the definition of an international recording artist. “It was crazy performing in the Middle East. Who would have guessed how big reggae music is there? They knew all my songs,” a jubilant Collie Buddz explains. He has toured throughout Germany, France, England, Japan, North and South America and the Caribbean. His unique blend of Hip-Hop, Soca and Dancehall underlined with his ever-present passion for the modern Roots Reggae sound has attracted tastemaker supporters all over the world. Reggae pioneer David Rodigan [London] and New York Reggae stalwarts at legendary radio station, Hot 97, Massive B and Short-Man [Heavy Hitters] are just some of his most ardent supporters. Now on the verge of Collie’s sophomore album release, the anticipation is palpable.\n<br><br>\nIn spite of averaging an eleven month yearly touring schedule since 2007, Collie Buddz is prepared to release a sophomore album that promises an even greater insight into the multi-talented, producer/singer-songwriter/performer. He’s also made time to work with some of the most respected producers and artists in the industry while also making beautiful music with the production team that made his debut album an overnight success. “We don’t have a title for the new album just yet but whatever we call it, the album will be mad,” Collie excitedly explains. With production by Supa Dups, Massive B and Seanie B among other contributors, Collie’s fans can anticipate Collie’s unique twist on popular music. Tony Kelly [K-Licious], producer of more crossover hits than any other producer in the genre [Sean Paul, Patra, Supercat, Wayne Wonder, Shaggy] and TJ Records [Beenie Man] return with production for this album as well. Among friends, Collie is known as a “studio rat,” as given any sort of free time in the schedule, Collie is hunkered down behind the boards of a recording studio. So it comes to no surprise to anyone that Collie is also ready to release a brand new mixtape. \n<br><br>\n“I was just in Los Angeles finishing a song with Sugar Ray, and I love the vibe on that track,” says Collie of the new mixtape. Also with verses on hit songs by Beyonce, Rihanna and Kid Cudi, the mixtape is sure to give Collie’s fans an appetizer to the entrée of the sophomore album. “I always want to give all the sound-systems and DJs something to rock the clubs with while I work on releasing my new material,” Collie says. It is this love for constantly creating that drives Collie Buddz. \n<br><br>\nWanting to release music more frequently and with fewer restrictions, Collie’s affiliation with Columbia Records/Sony Music Entertainment, Inc ended in 2008. He has since founded his own independent record label, Harper Digital alongside his brother [Smokey] and DJ [DJ Genie] while working with his longtime management group, Mojiza Management. The Harper Digital team is already grooming the label into a full production house and artist development business. Humble as always, Collie simply says, “I’m just excited to be putting out another album. I love to make music and the satisfaction is in having other people from all over the world enjoy it. I live out of a suitcase and I wouldn’t have it any other way.” And Collie means just what he says.\n<br><br>\nWith a nonstop touring schedule with his band The New Kingston Band and his longtime compatriot and hype man, Pee Wee, Collie just has one quick stop before hitting the road yet again. He’s got to stop by the embassy and pick up more page inserts for his passport.","hometown":"Bermuda","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/collie-buddz","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"Collie Buddz, from the isle of Bermuda, has done something not impossible but something once seemingly very implausible.

He’s got to stop by the embassy and pick up more page inserts for his passport.","musicbrainz_id":null}},"category":"Music","end_time":"Fri, 05 Aug 2011 15:45:00 -0500","google_date":"20110805T194500Z/20110805T204500Z","title":"Collie Buddz","updated_at":"2011-06-15 13:00:18 -0500","conference_category":null,"time":"02:45 PM","date":"Friday 08/05/11","id":"462290","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/event/2011/08/05/collie-buddz","photo_thumb_small":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14937/sq_44.JPG","start_time":"Fri, 05 Aug 2011 14:45:00 -0500"},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14935/sq_90.JPG","votes":"1063","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/events/462291.json","bands":{"band":{"display_date":"2011-08-05","photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14935/sq_90.JPG","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14935/original.JPG","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/154508.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"17","location":"Lineup - Perrys","tier":"4"}},"main_lineup_position":"138","facebook_url":null,"twitter_username":null,"setlist":null,"title":"Feed Me","updated_at":"2011-06-15 03:49:12 -0500","youtube_id":"kRJ2YvRv3N4","similar_bands":{"similar_band":[{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/101469.json","title":"Skrillex"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/83670.json","title":"Chuckie"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/64395.json","title":"MIDNIGHT CONSPIRACY"}]},"flickr_tag":"feedme","id":"154508","echonest_id":"ARMDBMT11E2835CA45","homepage":"http://www.myspace.com/feedmerightnow","myspace_link":"http://www.myspace.com/feedmerightnow","fan_count":"1118","description":"Debuting by being the first external artist to feature on the infamous mau5trap label, Feed Me's array of hard hitting electronica with a grin quickly caught the eyes and ears of listeners worldwide.

The idea of breaking\nboundaries permeates their music\nbecause this dissolution of cultural\nborders is ingrained in their very\nidentities.\n<br /><br />\nThe electronic production team of Gernot Bronsert and Sebastian Szary came\nof age in Berlin shortly after the fall of the infamous Wall in 1989. It was a\nplace and time where breaking down boundaries was not a convenient\nmeme, but rather a literal description of what was going on outside their front\ndoors. Germany was a stew of mixed emotions, high hopes and insecurity, all\nexisting at the same time as the reunited populace attempted to right itself\nanew.\n<br /><br />\nThrust upon the unique cultural landscape of the newly liberated city, the two\nformer East Berliners found themselves in the ultimate urban jungle, deep in\nthe realm of the absurd. In this liminal state of upheaval and change,\nanything was possible. As cops and parents preoccupied themselves with\nother concerns, the youth took advantage of the obtuse authorities to throw\nwild underground acid house parties. And this is where Modeselektor met: in\nthe midst of the chaos, swimming in the heady sense of freedom that only\nthose once oppressed can truly understand. It was 1995.\n<br /><br />\nModeselektor emerged out of the tangle of post-wall Berlin, monkey men with\nbeats clenched between their teeth and ideas that would soon force music\njournalists to make up new words: bastard dancehall, euro crunk, acid rap,\nbig bass techno, labstyle, happy metal, psychedelic electro. Like a jungle,\ntheir music is dense, textured and rich with sounds never experienced before,\ndrawn from a production ethos of “create, distort, recycle.” Modeselektor’s\nappreciation for the absurd engenders an attitude of levity towards their music,\nrefreshing in a world where “serious techno” has become a funny cliché.\nAfter trying out the name Fundamental Knowledge, the duo soon found a\nmoniker with a better fit: Modeselektor, taken from a function on the Roland\nRE-201 space echo analog delay effects unit. They progressed from DJ sets\nto a live act and began playing small open airs in Berlin with Pfadfinderei, a\nlocal design collective whose avant-garde visual contributions aptly reflect the\ntranslation of their name: pathfinders. In 2001 Modeselektor met Ellen Allien\nwho quickly signed the promising minds to her label BPitch Control, one of\nthe most highly respected techno labels in the world. The catapult was\nloaded.\n<br /><br />\nA series of singles, EPs and remixes ensued, along with exciting collaboration\nwith Parisian rap group TTC as well as Berlin wunderkind Apparat under the\nname Moderat. Modeselektor began to draw international attention and soon\nsnagged the ears of one Thom Yorke, who declared his love for their music on\ntelevision. Now immersed in the European artistic community, the producers\npresented sound installations at the Centre Pompidou in Paris and lectured at\nthe Merz Academie in Stuttgart.\n<br /><br />\nAfter years of intense touring all over Europe, in 2005 Modeselektor finally\nreleased their first full-length album Hello Mom! on their home label, BPitch\nControl. Cue the world tour and rave reviews for a release that soared beyond\nthe normal strata of electronic output with its potent celebration of sonic\ndiversity, equally as enjoyable for the headphone listener and the sweaty\nclubber at 3AM.\n<br /><br />\nAs if there was any question about this duo’s aptitude, in 2007 the album\nHappy Birthday! (BPitch Control) dropped and subsequently detonated with\nsupreme force.

The idea of breaking\nboundaries permeates their music\nbecause this dissolution of cultural\nborders is ingrained in their very\nidentities.\n<br /><br />\nThe electronic production team of Gernot Bronsert and Sebastian Szary came\nof age in Berlin shortly after the fall of the infamous Wall in 1989. It was a\nplace and time where breaking down boundaries was not a convenient\nmeme, but rather a literal description of what was going on outside their front\ndoors. Germany was a stew of mixed emotions, high hopes and insecurity, all\nexisting at the same time as the reunited populace attempted to right itself\nanew.\n<br /><br />\nThrust upon the unique cultural landscape of the newly liberated city, the two\nformer East Berliners found themselves in the ultimate urban jungle, deep in\nthe realm of the absurd. In this liminal state of upheaval and change,\nanything was possible. As cops and parents preoccupied themselves with\nother concerns, the youth took advantage of the obtuse authorities to throw\nwild underground acid house parties. And this is where Modeselektor met: in\nthe midst of the chaos, swimming in the heady sense of freedom that only\nthose once oppressed can truly understand. It was 1995.\n<br /><br />\nModeselektor emerged out of the tangle of post-wall Berlin, monkey men with\nbeats clenched between their teeth and ideas that would soon force music\njournalists to make up new words: bastard dancehall, euro crunk, acid rap,\nbig bass techno, labstyle, happy metal, psychedelic electro. Like a jungle,\ntheir music is dense, textured and rich with sounds never experienced before,\ndrawn from a production ethos of “create, distort, recycle.” Modeselektor’s\nappreciation for the absurd engenders an attitude of levity towards their music,\nrefreshing in a world where “serious techno” has become a funny cliché.\nAfter trying out the name Fundamental Knowledge, the duo soon found a\nmoniker with a better fit: Modeselektor, taken from a function on the Roland\nRE-201 space echo analog delay effects unit. They progressed from DJ sets\nto a live act and began playing small open airs in Berlin with Pfadfinderei, a\nlocal design collective whose avant-garde visual contributions aptly reflect the\ntranslation of their name: pathfinders. In 2001 Modeselektor met Ellen Allien\nwho quickly signed the promising minds to her label BPitch Control, one of\nthe most highly respected techno labels in the world. The catapult was\nloaded.\n<br /><br />\nA series of singles, EPs and remixes ensued, along with exciting collaboration\nwith Parisian rap group TTC as well as Berlin wunderkind Apparat under the\nname Moderat. Modeselektor began to draw international attention and soon\nsnagged the ears of one Thom Yorke, who declared his love for their music on\ntelevision. Now immersed in the European artistic community, the producers\npresented sound installations at the Centre Pompidou in Paris and lectured at\nthe Merz Academie in Stuttgart.\n<br /><br />\nAfter years of intense touring all over Europe, in 2005 Modeselektor finally\nreleased their first full-length album Hello Mom! on their home label, BPitch\nControl. Cue the world tour and rave reviews for a release that soared beyond\nthe normal strata of electronic output with its potent celebration of sonic\ndiversity, equally as enjoyable for the headphone listener and the sweaty\nclubber at 3AM.\n<br /><br />\nAs if there was any question about this duo’s aptitude, in 2007 the album\nHappy Birthday! (BPitch Control) dropped and subsequently detonated with\nsupreme force. Minds frothed and limbs flailed as the next era of grimetechno-\ndubstep-acid-hip hop-electro-IDM was inaugurated, influencing\nproducers and DJs around the world to employ Modeselektor’s samples and\nmethods to bring a boundary-less musical experience to their listeners as\nwell.

Weird? Maybe, but consider it practice for the place Scott \"Kid Cudi\" Mescudi finds himself now. The rapper from Cleveland quit a restaurant job in his hometown of Shaker Heights after his boss encouraged him to leave Ohio and carve his lane in the entertainment industry. By then, Cudi was already rapping on the local circuit, and when he decided to drop out of college after his freshman year, he moved to New York City on October 7, 2004. In his pocket? A demo tape and $500 cash.\n<br /><br />\nNYC was a new beginning for Cudi. A loner in a city where he didn't know anyone, Cudi would walk aimlessly through Times Square and go to the movies by himself. His uncle, the last sibling of Cudi’s father who died of cancer when he was 11, allowed him to stay in his South Bronx apartment. Cudi slept on a couch while juggling retail jobs at stores like American Apparel and A Bathing Ape and clocking long hours at the recording studio every night with his managers Plain Pat and Emile. (In 2008, Cudi and his partners started the indie label Dream On.) Cudi fell into the typical MC grind until tragedy struck in 2006: His uncle suffered the same fate as Cudi’s father and passed away. Cudi went back to Cleveland for the funeral in a emotional funk which inspired \"Day N Nite\"—the song that would change his life forever. Recorded in a pitch-black room, Cudi put his heart into the gloomy pop-hit. After posting it on his MySpace, the song started racking up hits and eventually caught the attention of A-Trak, Kanye West's former tour DJ. \n<br /><br />\nA-Trak fell in love with song, and Cudi ended up signing a single deal on the DJ’s \"Fool's Gold\" label. A critically-acclaimed mixtape, presented by Pat and Emile and co-branded with NYC streetwear label 10 Deep called \"A KiD Named CuDi\" was the MC's  first full body of work, and released on July 17, 2008 . Things were looking up, but the game truly changed when A-Trak played \"Day N Nite\" at Kanye West's \"Stronger\" premiere party. West loved the song,and saw enough potential in Cudi that he flew him out to Hawaii to do reference hooks for Jay-Z's The Blueprint 3. Soon, ‘Ye and Cudi started work on Kanye's 808s & Heartbreak album. Cudi's sing-songy, eclectic style was the perfect match for 808s, and the up-and-comer ended up writing four songs (“Heartless,” “Paranoid,” “Welcome To Heartbreak,” and “Robocop”). Before long, the kid from Cleveland was beginning to creep into the mainstream. With hype (and Kanye) behind him and a Billboard hit with \"Day N Nite,\" Cudi inked a deal with Kanye's G.O.O.D music label. Soon after, he parlayed that into a major deal with Universal Motown.  \n<br /><br />\nOn September 15, 2009, Kid Cudi released his debut album Man On The Moon: The End Of Day, a genre-bending concept album that took people through Scott Mescudi's dreams, nightmares, and unique views of the world.  The album—which featured production from Emile, Plain Pat, RATATAT, MGMT and Kanye West—sold 104,419 copies its first week, good enough for #4 on the Billboard chart. The album's reception, both critical and commercial, proved Universal Motown President Sylvia Rhone's assertion that Cudi was a  \"game-changer in hip-hop\". \n<br /><br />\nAnd a game-changer he has been. As the stats go for Cudder, to date he's sold over 4.6 million digital singles, 1.3 million mobiletones, and according to The Hype Machine, he is among the top ten most blogged about artists of all-time. As of August 2010, Cudi's videos on VEVO clock in at over 32 million views. In addition to being sought-after for his music, top-tier companies like Converse and Heineken have tapped Kid Cudi to appear in campaigns like \"3 Artists, 1 Song\" and \"Plug into Summer,\" respectively, while Askmen.com has labeled him a \"Style Icon.\"\n<br /><br />\nAfter his debut album dropped, Cudi set off on a sold-out city-to-city tour with Asher Roth (\"The Great Hangover Tour\") and appeared as the main attraction at festivals like Audiotistic and Bonnaroo, all while prepping his sophomore album, Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager.  The highly-anticipated album, set to release November 9, will feature Kanye West, Mary J. Blige and GLC, with production from Emile, Plain Pat, Jim Jonsin, Diplo, Dot Da Genius and others. Its first single, \"Erase Me,\" debuted at #22 on Billboard's Hot 100 when it released on iTunes this past August.  Cudi promises that the album will be darker than its first, and will build on the cinematic theme that he prides his music on.
