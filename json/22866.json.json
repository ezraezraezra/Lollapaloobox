While the next few years present endless possibilities, Dani plans to focus primarily on her own production and DJing while nurturing Calamity Jane. “It’s no longer good enough to be just a DJ. ” she says. “The question now in our industry is, ‘what are you giving back?’ I can say for me, with the utmost confidence…a lot.”","musicbrainz_id":null}},"category":"Music","end_time":"Fri, 05 Aug 2011 20:30:00 -0500","google_date":"20110806T003000Z/20110806T013000Z","title":"Dani Deahl","updated_at":"2011-06-15 12:59:43 -0500","conference_category":null,"time":"07:30 PM","date":"Friday 08/05/11","id":"462276","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/event/2011/08/05/tbd","photo_thumb_small":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/15525/sq_44.jpeg","start_time":"Fri, 05 Aug 2011 19:30:00 -0500"},{"photo_thumb":"http://cdn3.dostuffmedia.com/themes/festival_lollapalooza/images/icons/logo_90.gif","votes":"287","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/events/462316.json","bands":{"band":{"display_date":null,"photo_thumb":null,"photo":null,"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/64845.json","main_lineup_position":"4","facebook_url":"http://www.facebook.com/jroddywalston","twitter_username":"jroddybusiness","setlist":null,"title":"J Roddy Walston and The Business","updated_at":"2011-04-11 13:57:23 -0500","youtube_id":"2lkMn-rUYiE","flickr_tag":"jroddywalstonandthebusiness","id":"64845","echonest_id":null,"homepage":"http://www.vagrant.com/jroddywalstonandthebusiness/","myspace_link":null,"fan_count":"281","description":"Coming out of Baltimore, MD (via Cleveland, TN) the band has hit the road with such regularity that its recorded work can seem almost an afterthought.

We tried to keep doing what we’re doing, while expanding and growing at the same time.”\n<br><br>\nThe Lips – Alexander, singer-bassist Jared Swilley, singer-guitarist Ian St. Pé, and singer-drummer Joe Bradley – had never collaborated with a producer before embarking on their current album. This time, however, the band set out to work with one of the producers on their short list: Mark Ronson, the English producer known for both his sharply-honed solo albums Version and Record Collection and his production work for the likes of Sean Paul, Nas, Adele, Kaiser Chiefs, Duran Duran, Lily Allen, and most notably U.K. soul-pop diva Amy Winehouse’s international breakthrough Back to Black.\n<br><br>\n“When that came out, we thought, for mainstream pop, this has a cool retro sensibility that we appreciate,” Cole says. “We knew he had the potential to get an older sound. We’re not purists who just want to sound old, but there are certain recording techniques that were used a long time ago that sound really good, and can be used in today’s context. We felt he understood that.”\n<br><br>\nWhile the Lips have by no means turned their backs on the storming punk and garage-rock that is the core of their confrontational style, working with Ronson allowed them to work at a more relaxed pace and refine their song-oriented side. “We’ve gone in and done a whole album in a week,” Cole says. “After our last album, we plateaued with that approach. We decided to spend a lot of time and actually work on this record. It ended up taking a year and a half, which is the longest we’ve ever spent. We had some good pop songs in the past, but they got buried in the swampy production. Beefing up the production made a difference. It was a little outside the box for us, and a little outside Mark’s box as well.”\n<br><br>\nAlthough the majority of Arabia Mountain was cut with Ronson at MetroSonic Recording Studios in Brooklyn, two songs, “Go Out and Get It” and “Bicentennial Man,” were recorded by Lockett Pundt of Deerhunter in Atlanta. Cole says, “We did those two songs on four-track cassette, and that’s old-school Black Lips – that’s how we first started recording. I just really like cassette sounds. It’s really compact and punchy.”\n<br><br>\nArabia Mountain careens through a typically wild catalog of subject matter: touring the Dali Museum, high (“Modern Art”), backwards masking and double suicide (“Mad Dog”), the superhero as molestation victim (“Spidey’s Curse”), the joys and perils of uncooked food (“Raw Meat”), the saga of the Atlanta Braves’ team mascot (“Noc-A-Homa”). “We went further with this record than we ever did in the past,” Cole says. “If you listen to the lyrics to some songs, they’re a little deeper, I think.”\n<br><br>\nWhile straight-ahead revved-up rock is not in short supply, the new collection pushes the band’s stylistic boundaries. “Family Tree” found its musical inspiration in a Bolivian folk tune heard on a compilation produced by the eclectic Atlanta label Dust-to-Digital. “Dumpster Dive” is a full-on plunge into Rolling Stones-style country. And “Don’t Mess My Baby” uses tribal drumming to convert a song that began life as Bobby Fuller-styled pop-rockabilly into something approaching South African township jive.","hometown":"ATLANTA, US","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/black-lips","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"Arabia Mountain, the sixth studio album and fourth Vice Records release by the Black Lips, finds the hell-raising Atlanta quartet digging deep into the roots of their exposed-nerve sound and simultaneously exploring surprising new possibilities in their music – or as one of their new songs puts it, “lookin’ in a new direction.” Singer-guitarist Cole Alexander explains, “We tried to do what we do best, and keep it raw, but we also opened up to working with a producer and experimenting with new sounds.

As chart-toppers and headliners, they’ve crossed over genres, defied categorization and confused the hell out of your iPod (“Heavy Metal?” “Hard Rock?” “Alternative?”) Above all, Deftones have stuck together throughout their often-turbulent tenure, and now, deliver one of the most compelling records of their career.\n<br /><br />\nThe 11-track album is just that—an album from start to finish. Diamond Eyes works the way good records used to; each song carries you a little further away from your shitty day until finally, you’ve been transported to a place that feels a whole lot better than where you started. “There are so many emotions that music can give you, and if you explore all sides of those, it can be really amazing,” says Moreno. “Like sadness -- it can be really lovely, or beautiful, or wide open, or coarse. We connect with different emotions because we listen to everything out there—that could mean dumb music or something by Brian Eno. Then when we play, it’s not a real conscious thing, but the emotion builds and it takes us in a lot of different ways. I think that’s what music’s supposed to do.”\n<br /><br />\nThe tangle of Stephen Carpenter’s woozy, undulating guitar work and Moreno’s soaring then secretive vocal style is the bittersweet dynamic behind each of Deftones' records, including Diamond Eyes. The friction drives the music as much as it does the players, though it doesn’t always make life easy for childhood friends Carpenter and Moreno. “What makes us work?” asks Carpenter. “Chino will give you the exact opposite answer that I do. That’s the way it is with us—we contradict each other constantly but it’s also what makes our music what it is—intense and different.”\n<br /><br />\nThere’s also a newfound sense of purpose that makes Deftones' sixth album stand out. The band recorded the album after their best friend and bassist Chi Cheng sustained a debilitating brain injury from a car accident in November of 2008. “After Chi’s accident, it would have been easy for us to make a sad record,” says Moreno. “It felt like there was a cloud around us, so we aimed to make something uplifting. I think that’s why there’s a lot of fantasy stuff on the record. I tried to take it away from day to day life, and make it more about the abstract, about art. It sounds odd, but really, this is an optimistic record.” And a spontaneous one.\n<br /><br />\nDiamond Eyes was made in a mere six months with the help of former Quicksand bassist Sergio Vega and producer Nick Raskulinecz of Foo Fighters, Alice In Chains, and Rush fame. Oddly enough, Deftones had just come off recording another full album, Eros, which they ultimately shelved. Moreno says, “Honestly, I knew there was something better to come.” Starting over was a bold move considering Deftones traditionally take their time writing and recording each album. Drummer Abe Cunningham was concerned about the decision, especially since it had been so difficult making records in the past. “Each one was getting to be like pulling teeth, and beyond—maybe like surgery without anesthesia,” he adds. “But this time, we just said fuck it, we’re still best friends, all of us -- and we’re still able to do this. So we just lightened up and got creative, and we’re firing on all cylinders.”\n<br /><br />\nThese days, Deftones are far more unified than ever before, but that hasn’t always been the case. Tensions began to mount following their breakthrough record “White Pony” in 2000.  It was their first to top the Billboard charts, win a Grammy and earn Platinum certification.  In the wake of their success, the band toured nonstop; a grueling schedule that gave way to 24/7 road-life, in-fighting, and eventually, burnout. Carpenter and Moreno’s disputation over the direction of music escalated to the point where the pair stopped speaking all together. By the time their 2003 self-titled album was release, Cunningham says they all had their nicknames for the difficult period in which it was recorded. “Steph calls it the Downward Spiral. I refer to it as Dark Days.” The conflict made the band’s life hell, but it gave the music press something to write about in the stretch between albums. “A lot of that was trumped up, but we’ve definitely had some heavy times,” says keyboardist Frank Delgado, who joined the band originally as a turntableist in the mid 90s.  “Still one of the best things about this band is that we just don’t give up. As dysfunctional as it can be, we still make it work. And I really don’t know what the press thinks of us now, but I like that. There should be some mysticism there. Maybe they should think we’re off our rocker.” And deconstructing the band’s mental state is an easy task compared to categorizing the music they make.\n<br /><br />\nCritics, marketers and radio alike have struggled with just where to place or how to define Deftones.

It’s hard to put us in one place. I don’t blame people when they try to do it, because I can’t even pin it myself. But really, does it matter?”  Not when you’re as compelling, diverse, powerful and pretty as Deftones.","hometown":null,"link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/deftones","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"“Pretty,” affirms Deftones singer and guitarist Chino Moreno when discussing their new full-length studio album, Diamond Eyes.  “We’re not afraid to be pretty.” It’s an adjective most riff-heavy groups might avoid, but then, Deftones have never been your average hard rock band.\n<br /><br />\nAs kids, the Sacramento fivesome cut its teeth on Anthrax and The Smiths, Pantera and The Cure, skateboarding and “The Smurfs.” As a band out of high school, Deftones mixed trip hop with thrash, melodic vocals with crushing reverb, and yes, pretty with ugly. As chart-toppers and headliners, they’ve crossed over genres, defied categorization and confused the hell out of your iPod (“Heavy Metal?” “Hard Rock?” “Alternative?”) Above all, Deftones have stuck together throughout their often-turbulent tenure, and now, deliver one of the most compelling records of their career.\n<br /><br />\nThe 11-track album is just that—an album from start to finish. Diamond Eyes works the way good records used to; each song carries you a little further away from your shitty day until finally, you’ve been transported to a place that feels a whole lot better than where you started. “There are so many emotions that music can give you, and if you explore all sides of those, it can be really amazing,” says Moreno. “Like sadness -- it can be really lovely, or beautiful, or wide open, or coarse. We connect with different emotions because we listen to everything out there—that could mean dumb music or something by Brian Eno. Then when we play, it’s not a real conscious thing, but the emotion builds and it takes us in a lot of different ways. I think that’s what music’s supposed to do.”\n<br /><br />\nThe tangle of Stephen Carpenter’s woozy, undulating guitar work and Moreno’s soaring then secretive vocal style is the bittersweet dynamic behind each of Deftones' records, including Diamond Eyes. The friction drives the music as much as it does the players, though it doesn’t always make life easy for childhood friends Carpenter and Moreno. “What makes us work?” asks Carpenter. “Chino will give you the exact opposite answer that I do. That’s the way it is with us—we contradict each other constantly but it’s also what makes our music what it is—intense and different.”\n<br /><br />\nThere’s also a newfound sense of purpose that makes Deftones' sixth album stand out. The band recorded the album after their best friend and bassist Chi Cheng sustained a debilitating brain injury from a car accident in November of 2008. “After Chi’s accident, it would have been easy for us to make a sad record,” says Moreno. “It felt like there was a cloud around us, so we aimed to make something uplifting. I think that’s why there’s a lot of fantasy stuff on the record. I tried to take it away from day to day life, and make it more about the abstract, about art. It sounds odd, but really, this is an optimistic record.” And a spontaneous one.\n<br /><br />\nDiamond Eyes was made in a mere six months with the help of former Quicksand bassist Sergio Vega and producer Nick Raskulinecz of Foo Fighters, Alice In Chains, and Rush fame. Oddly enough, Deftones had just come off recording another full album, Eros, which they ultimately shelved. Moreno says, “Honestly, I knew there was something better to come.” Starting over was a bold move considering Deftones traditionally take their time writing and recording each album. Drummer Abe Cunningham was concerned about the decision, especially since it had been so difficult making records in the past. “Each one was getting to be like pulling teeth, and beyond—maybe like surgery without anesthesia,” he adds. “But this time, we just said fuck it, we’re still best friends, all of us -- and we’re still able to do this. So we just lightened up and got creative, and we’re firing on all cylinders.”\n<br /><br />\nThese days, Deftones are far more unified than ever before, but that hasn’t always been the case. Tensions began to mount following their breakthrough record “White Pony” in 2000.  It was their first to top the Billboard charts, win a Grammy and earn Platinum certification.  In the wake of their success, the band toured nonstop; a grueling schedule that gave way to 24/7 road-life, in-fighting, and eventually, burnout. Carpenter and Moreno’s disputation over the direction of music escalated to the point where the pair stopped speaking all together. By the time their 2003 self-titled album was release, Cunningham says they all had their nicknames for the difficult period in which it was recorded. “Steph calls it the Downward Spiral.

When they reformed in 2008, it was \nstraight to Europe, all self funded and D to the I Y, they did almost a month of \nfestivals and packed headlining shows. Then Australia for Soundwaves, some \nUS dates which included the Fun Fun Fun festival, some CMJ shows, and a \nlovely evening supporting the Bad Brains in NYC. It was back to Europe in the \nsummer of 2009 where they supported The Deftones and Rise Against, then to \nJapan. Rival Schools signed with Photo Finish/Atlantic records early in 2010, \nPedals is due out March 8th, and the band plans to support it, then break up for eight years again, (thatʼs a joke). \n<br><br>\n“This record was put together with a greater sense of purpose and band identity,” explained Rival Schoolsʼ singer and guitarist, Walter Schreifels. “Iʼm happy that weʼve been able to come back to it with so much positive energy, with the challenge of making a new record and plotting a new creative course.” ","musicbrainz_id":null}},"category":"Music","end_time":"Sun, 07 Aug 2011 14:30:00 -0500","google_date":"20110807T184500Z/20110807T193000Z","title":"Rival Schools","updated_at":"2011-06-15 13:10:08 -0500","conference_category":null,"time":"01:45 PM","date":"Sunday 08/07/11","id":"462359","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/event/2011/08/07/rival-schools","photo_thumb_small":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14978/sq_44.JPG","start_time":"Sun, 07 Aug 2011 13:45:00 -0500"},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14911/sq_90.jpg","votes":"3707","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/events/462360.json","bands":{"band":{"display_date":"2011-08-07","photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14911/sq_90.jpg","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14911/original.jpg","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/40618.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"45","location":"Lineup - Main","tier":"4"}},"main_lineup_position":"69","facebook_url":"http://www.facebook.com/cityandcolour","twitter_username":"cityandcolour","setlist":null,"title":"City and Colour","updated_at":"2011-06-11 01:46:04 -0500","youtube_id":"5msZ_R-jDnc","similar_bands":{"similar_band":[{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/37852.json","title":"Bright Eyes"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/45247.json","title":"An Horse"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/98787.json","title":"Fences"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/12684.json","title":"Portugal.

But the struggles never pushed singer Matt Shultz, guitarist Brad Shultz, bassist Daniel Tichenor, guitarist Lincoln Parish, and drummer Jared Champion off track — they only strengthened the group's bond and fueled the revved-up roar of its new album, set for release on January 11, 2011, which promises to launch the new year with a ferocious kick of gut-grabbing rock & roll.\n<br /><br />\n\"This album brought me back to life,\" says Matt Shultz. \"We totally turned away from fear-based writing. We just wanted to make music that we loved.\" Cage the Elephant were literally itching to get new music into fans' hands after spending years promoting their debut, which has sold close to 400,000 copies and spawned three Top 5 singles. In the time since they laid down their first album, the band has done a lot of living — and a lot of growing — and the maturity of their fresh sound shines through on the new album. \n<br /><br />\nThe band sketched out 80 song ideas during a nearly two-year stint living in England, but wound up scrapping all the work once they returned to the U.S. and dove into a period of intense musical growth. They listened to the Pixies, Mudhoney and Butthole Surfers and explored '50s surf rock for inspiration. After two weeks of total isolation in remote Kentucky cabins, they emerged with a fresh slate of songs and a renewed promise to be honest to themselves.\n<br /><br />\n\"On the first record I think I was really frustrated and angry at the world and writing about its problems and my frustrations with them,\" Matt Shultz says, \"but on this record I realized I was part of the hypocrisy. And I was like, wow, I'm a real piece of shit.\" On opener \"Always Something,\" he sings ominously about how there's \"always something waiting for you\" over creepy, slinky guitars. \"There were a lot of things in my life I was trying to control and it all unraveled in a real bad way,\" Matt says. \"Because everything fell apart I had to face up to everything. Some songs are a direct attack on myself.\"\n<br /><br />\n\"Shake Me Down\" is packed with explosive loud-quiet-loud interludes that showcase Champion's skills on a set of toy drums that were expertly recorded by Jay Joyce, who also produced Cage the Elephant's debut. The guitar riff was actually borrowed from a song Tichenor's dad had written years ago (\"I ripped him off,\" the bassist jokes), and the bass line was inspired by the Shins. \n<br /><br />\nOne of the band's biggest goals for the disc — not to conform to a popular sound or look — became a bit of a crusade. \"Sell Yourself\" is a ferocious, thrashing ode to staying true to their identity despite the pressures of the industry. \"Indy Kidz\" skewers the pretentiousness of music scenes where everyone just wants to fit in before it stretches out into a trippy jam. And Matt Shultz breaks out his best Frank Black yell to let off steam on \"Tangled,\" one of several amped-up songs he's looking forward to tearing apart live during the band's mind-blowingly energetic shows. (Matt is known for his head-banging, stage-diving and crazy punk-rock antics.)\n<br /><br />\nWhile Matt says he had plenty of material to draw on — everything from the end of his five-year relationship to watching a close friend self-destruct to feeling frustrated with how Americans are \"slaves to advertisements\" — at times his lyrics didn't exactly flow. Brad Shultz cracks up recalling how he found Matt outside the Nashville studio, \"Laying in the leaves, like, 'I need to be inspired!'  \"I was trying to generate some sort of inspiration, so I was grabbing leaves and smelling them and smelling dirt,\" Matt explains. \"I just wanted a sound or a texture or a feel or a smell to generate some sort of memory from childhood.\"\n<br /><br />\nSometimes the studio's struggles brought the band its greatest rewards. Super-catchy anthem \"Aberdeen\" required three days of agonizing work. When the band slowed down the chorus, the tune finally clicked and a worthwhile lesson emerged. \"It was definitely realizing you don't always have control of a situation,\" Matt Shultz says. \"If you want to make something you love it doesn’t always happen the first time around.\"\n<br /><br />\n\"We didn't have all the answers on our first album,\" Brad Shultz adds. \"But we were just like, fuck this, we're going to write the music we're going to write.
