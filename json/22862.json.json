Kerli notes, “This song and video really set the tone for my new album.   I am very happy that I can launch it with such a strong partnership with AOL and reach so many people. I hope that the message - creating an Army of Love that will bring Integrity, Love and Unity into the world -- will inspire young people in all areas of their lives.”\n<br /><br />\nKerli’s vision of Integrity, Love, Unity permeates her writing process and her life. She launched a community four years ago to live these concepts herself and with her fans. These three components are represented by the “moon dots” that she and her fans (Moon Children) wear.\n<br /><br />\nKerli describes her first cd as the “struggle” while the new release will be about “overcoming that struggle, and going through the tunnel and into the light.” She explains, “The first album was really all about painful and introverted experiences, while this album really reflects how one goes through that pain and rises above it, to be the best that you can be.”","musicbrainz_id":null}},"category":"Music","end_time":"Fri, 05 Aug 2011 15:45:00 -0500","google_date":"20110805T200000Z/20110805T204500Z","title":"Kerli","updated_at":"2011-06-15 11:54:40 -0500","conference_category":null,"time":"03:00 PM","date":"Friday 08/05/11","id":"462255","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/event/2011/08/05/kerli","photo_thumb_small":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14975/sq_44.JPG","start_time":"Fri, 05 Aug 2011 15:00:00 -0500"},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14969/sq_90.JPG","votes":"921","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/events/462256.json","bands":{"band":{"display_date":"2011-08-05","photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14969/sq_90.JPG","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14969/original.JPG","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/61332.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"89","location":"Lineup - Main","tier":"5"}},"main_lineup_position":"111","facebook_url":"http://www.facebook.com/kidsthesedaysband","twitter_username":"kidsthesedays","setlist":null,"title":"Kids These Days","updated_at":"2011-05-05 19:44:57 -0500","youtube_id":"mriAvnEctro","similar_bands":{"similar_band":[{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/62129.json","title":"Foster The People"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/125413.json","title":"Black Cards"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/135801.json","title":"Patrick Stump"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/103753.json","title":"The Kingston Springs"}]},"flickr_tag":"kidsthesedays","id":"61332","echonest_id":"AR7V8LD1187FB3E8A5","homepage":"http://www.facebook.com/kidsthesedaysband","myspace_link":"http://www.myspace.com/kidsthesedaysband","fan_count":"969","description":"The members who make up Chicago-bred band Kids These Days hail from\nevery corner of the music spectrum and varying neighborhoods of\nChicago, but their collective sound creates a hybrid genre influenced by\nequal parts jazz, funk, blues, soul and hip-hop.

After years of touring and recording as singer and multi-instrumentalist for Fall Out Boy, Stump wrote and recorded SOUL PUNK throughout 2010. About the title, he reveals, “Neither I nor my music seem comfortably defined by the DIY punk or R&amp;B/hip-hop scenes–I feel like I operate between the margins. I want to contribute to the musical vernacular of both. I’m just as pissed off as I was while screaming in punk bands, but I feel like I'm directing it into something positive and centered around love.”\n<br><br>\nCommitted to nurturing the devoted fan base he has acquired throughout this career, Stump has invited fans to choose between two versions of a track on SOUL PUNK. Fans are asked to select which version of the song “Spotlight” they prefer – the more up-tempo version titled “New Regrets” or the more melancholy “Oh Nostalgia”. The winning version will end up on SOUL PUNK. To vote go to www.patrickstump.com.\n<br><br>\nIn addition to producing the album, as well as writing all the music and lyrics, Stump played all instruments on the recording, which include drums, bass, electric and acoustic guitars, piano, analog synths, drum kit, marching drums, percussion, trumpet, valve trombone, alto and tenor saxophones, mandolin, guitelele, and manipulating various found sounds and ambient noises. The songs hit on a variety of themes, including his love for his hometown of Chicago in “This City,” a scathing treatise about materialism on “Greed,” and a reminiscent musing on naïve sexuality on “Allie.”\n<br><br>\nPrior to SOUL PUNK, Patrick Stump was the lead singer and composer for Fall Out Boy, which earned a Grammy nod along with commercial and critical success.

After years of touring and recording as singer and multi-instrumentalist for Fall Out Boy, Stump wrote and recorded SOUL PUNK throughout 2010. About the title, he reveals, “Neither I nor my music seem comfortably defined by the DIY punk or R&amp;B/hip-hop scenes–I feel like I operate between the margins. I want to contribute to the musical vernacular of both. I’m just as pissed off as I was while screaming in punk bands, but I feel like I'm directing it into something positive and centered around love.”\n<br><br>\nCommitted to nurturing the devoted fan base he has acquired throughout this career, Stump has invited fans to choose between two versions of a track on SOUL PUNK. Fans are asked to select which version of the song “Spotlight” they prefer – the more up-tempo version titled “New Regrets” or the more melancholy “Oh Nostalgia”. The winning version will end up on SOUL PUNK. To vote go to www.patrickstump.com.\n<br><br>\nIn addition to producing the album, as well as writing all the music and lyrics, Stump played all instruments on the recording, which include drums, bass, electric and acoustic guitars, piano, analog synths, drum kit, marching drums, percussion, trumpet, valve trombone, alto and tenor saxophones, mandolin, guitelele, and manipulating various found sounds and ambient noises. The songs hit on a variety of themes, including his love for his hometown of Chicago in “This City,” a scathing treatise about materialism on “Greed,” and a reminiscent musing on naïve sexuality on “Allie.”\n<br><br>\nPrior to SOUL PUNK, Patrick Stump was the lead singer and composer for Fall Out Boy, which earned a Grammy nod along with commercial and critical success. Stump has performed over 1200 shows and recorded five albums with FOB since their inception in 2001. Stump is also an accomplished producer and writer who has worked with Bruno Mars, Timbaland, Cobra Starship, Daryl Hall, Lupe Fiasco and more.","musicbrainz_id":null}},"category":"Music","end_time":"Sat, 06 Aug 2011 17:45:00 -0500","google_date":"20110806T220000Z/20110806T224500Z","title":"Patrick Stump","updated_at":"2011-06-15 13:02:10 -0500","conference_category":null,"time":"05:00 PM","date":"Saturday 08/06/11","id":"462300","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/event/2011/08/06/patrick-stump","photo_thumb_small":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14968/sq_44.JPG","start_time":"Sat, 06 Aug 2011 17:00:00 -0500"},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14966/sq_90.JPG","votes":"2099","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/events/462301.json","bands":{"band":{"display_date":"2011-08-06","photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14966/sq_90.JPG","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14966/original.JPG","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/117345.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"86","location":"Lineup - Main","tier":"5"}},"main_lineup_position":"108","facebook_url":"http://www.facebook.com/theprettyreckless","twitter_username":"taylormomsen","setlist":null,"title":"The Pretty Reckless","updated_at":"2011-05-05 19:44:58 -0500","youtube_id":"paudmGKB2FY","similar_bands":{"similar_band":[{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/44391.json","title":"Kerli"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/120117.json","title":"Christina Perri"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/45247.json","title":"An Horse"}]},"flickr_tag":"theprettyreckless","id":"117345","echonest_id":"ARKPWWW127BF5F14FE","homepage":"http://www.theprettyreckless.com/","myspace_link":"http://www.myspace.com/theprettyreckless","fan_count":"2242","description":"One night several years ago, Taylor Momsen’s father took his daughter to a White Stripes show. “Before that, the only concert I’d been to was Britney Spears,” says the singer, songwriter, and guitarist. “But once I saw Jack White onstage, that was it. I grew up as a dancer and I thought you had to dance to be a girl in the music industry. Then I saw the White Stripes and I was like, ‘No, you don’t. I can do that.’” Momsen was nine. \n<br /><br />\nJack White’s raw power and deceptively simple guitar-and-vocal attack proved to be highly influential on the now 16-year-old Momsen, who began humming melodies before she could talk and writing songs at the age of five after falling in love with The Beatles. “I was obsessed with them,” she says. “I also loved Led Zeppelin, The Who, Pink Floyd, Audioslave, Soundgarden, Oasis, and Nirvana. That’s what I listened to. My rock idols are all men.” \n<br /><br />\nSo it’s not surprising that Momsen channels a lot of masculine energy on LIGHT ME UP, her rock-and-roll-heroine-in-the-making debut album with her band The Pretty Reckless. The songs, all written by Momsen and Ben Phillips with their producer Kato Khandwala, run the gamut of emotions, alternating at times between seething rage and a bruised vulnerability. With Momsen’s inky vocals, pummeling riffs, and swaggering attitude, LIGHT ME UP sounds a bit like what might have happened had Led Zeppelin been fronted by “a chick.”  The album’s ferocity could raise an eyebrow from those expecting a pretty, blonde teenager to gravitate toward straight-up pop songwriting. “It’s heavier than people might expect from me,” says Momsen, who is best known as the actress who plays Jenny Humphrey on The CW’s Gossip Girl. “But this album is the most honest expression of who I truly am.”\n<br /><br />\nMomsen is a smart, emotionally complex young woman who has developed a strong identity despite growing up in the notoriously critical and fickle entertainment industry. Born and raised in St. Louis, MO, Taylor spent much of her time in NYC and at thirteen, she relocated to Manhattan. At two years old, Momsen signed to a modeling agency and a year later she began acting professionally appearing in commercials as well as films such as The Grinch Who Stole Christmas. In 2007 Momsen was cast as a lead in the CW show Gossip Girl. \n<br /><br />\n“I didn’t choose acting or modeling, I got thrown into it,” Momsen says. “I liked it, so that wasn’t a problem, but music and songwriting are what I’ve always really wanted to do. I’ve been working with producers and hanging out in recording studios since I was five, I just couldn’t put out an album when I was eight,” she says with a laugh. “Now I can.”\n<br /><br />\nLIGHT ME UP is an unflinchingly honest chronicle of Momsen’s experiences, filtered through her unique point of view. “The record is about life,” she says. “It covers everything: love, death, and music itself. It’s rock and roll. It’s sex. It’s drugs. It’s religion. It’s politics. Each song tells a story about the trials and tribulations and emotional struggles that I’ve experienced or observed. It’s not a happy pop record, but it’s not Satan-worshiping either. The lyrics aren’t meant to be taken literally, they are open to interpretation.”  \n<br /><br />\nThe songs tackle everything from romantic insecurity (the full-throttle rager “Make Me Wanna Die,” which also appears on the soundtrack to the film Kick-Ass), to despair (“You”), to how working non-stop can you make you feel like one of the un-dead (“Zombie”). Momsen pushes back against the haters on “Light Me Up” and asks how far you have to go to get forgiveness on “Going Down.” With her growly, world-weary alto, Momsen can do it all: garage-rock rave-ups (“Miss Nothing”), punchy blues-rock stompers (“My Medicine,” “Since You’re Gone”), as well as emotional power ballads (“Just Tonight”) and lovely acoustic guitar and string-driven numbers (“You”). \n<br /><br />\n “I’m not just writing something because I think people might like it,” Momsen says. “I hope they do, but I’m writing it because I have something to say. So many feelings go into the lyrics that it’s hard to explain what they’re about. Momsen first hooked up with Khandwala (Blondie, Drowning Pool, Paramore, Breaking Benjamin) and partner and songwriter, Phillips in October 2008.  By the spring of last year, they felt they had hit upon a sound that felt authentic to her.\n<br /><br />\n“The three of us have similar musical taste, so it was easy to find that singular vision,” Phillips says. “Kato and I worked very hard to help Taylor reach her potential because we could see how talented she was right off the bat. She went into the vocal booth and began to sing and we turned to each other and went, ‘Holy sh*t, she’s f**’ing great.’ Her voice was astonishing. So many artists these days let their voices be discombobulated by computers. Taylor doesn’t do that. She doesn’t need to. She can walk into a room and kick your ass.”   ","hometown":"New York, New York, US","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/the-pretty-reckless","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"One night several years ago, Taylor Momsen’s father took his daughter to a White Stripes show. “Before that, the only concert I’d been to was Britney Spears,” says the singer, songwriter, and guitarist. “But once I saw Jack White onstage, that was it.

He knows. Why, just a year ago, the Deerhunter frontman stumbled upon Caulfield’s organ-grinding rendition of “Rainwater Cassette Exchange” and said it’s “fantastically superior to the original. It actually sent shivers up my spine, especially during the second verse.”\n<br /><br />\nBelieve it or not, that chilling cover was just a warmup session.
