Solid, barnstorming rhythm. If you hear Northbrook Garage without seeing them, you’ll never guess the members are still in junior high. Their talent, arrangement style, and synergy are way beyond their years. From deep cut covers to infectious originals, the sound of Northbrook Garage is unexpectedly unique.\n<br><br>\nThe guys of Northbrook Garage -- Sam Harkey, Eric Doar, and Eric von Holst -- have been honing and tightening their sound since grammar school. When they met vocalist Elenna Sindler at a junior high talent night, the band was complete. NBG has an undeniable chemistry evident both on and off the stage. That vibe translates into tight grooves and that indescribable “something special”.\n<br><br>\nDescribed as Soulful Americana and Rootsy Groove, NBG finds the pulse in music and expresses themselves through their eclectic sound.
