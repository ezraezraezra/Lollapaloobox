The proof is there for\nall to hear on the band’s third album for Hollywood\nRecords, hitting Spring 2010, and marks an artistic\nbreakthrough for a vital young band caught in the\nact of fulfilling its immense promise. Little wonder\nthat Grace and her cohorts have chosen to title it,\ndirectly and emphatically, Grace Potter and the Nocturnals.\n<br />\n“This record is the first time it’s really been us — the first time we’ve all found each\nother and ourselves,” says Potter with obvious excitement. “Everybody was totally comfortable,\neverything we had was sitting right in front of us, and it just poured out of us.\nThe whole thing was fluid and effortless. In my mind, an album shouldn’t be self-titled\nunless it feels that way.”\n<br /><br />\nProduced by Mark Batson (Dr. Dre, Eminem, Jay-Z, Dave Matthews Band), who also cowrote\nsix of the 13 songs with Potter, Grace Potter and the Nocturnals introduces the\nVermont-based band’s new five-piece configuration, in which keyboard specialist Potter,\nlead guitarist Scott Tournet and drummer Matt Burr are joined by bassist Catherine\nPopper (Ryan Adams & the Cardinals, Hem) and rhythm guitarist Benny Yurco, who also\nplays with Tournet and Burr in the GPN side project Blues & Lasers.\n<br /><br />\n“We had a stylistic epiphany,” Potter says of her band’s exponential leap. “We realized\nwe’re not the kind of band that’s ever gonna fit neatly in one genre, and this time we\njust let the songs be the songs. We just naturally wound up playing them in a certain\nway — they all have that beat to them, a physicality and a mood. You have to either\nwant to dance to it or cry to it. But there’s also a feistiness to these songs that’s completely\nunapologetic.”\n<br /><br />\nOn deep-grooved, serrated rockers like “Medicine,” “Paris,” “Tiny Light” and “Oasis,” the\nnew model Grace Potter and the Nocturnals positively swaggers. Not only that, but the\nhooks are humongous, from Potter’s voice as she belts, teases and soars to Tournet’s\nuncoiling guitar riffs, positively lethal in their aggressiveness. “Oasis” showcases the\nband’s newly mounted dual-guitar firepower, as Tournet and Yurco interweave spiraling\nlines over a refracted hip-hop groove deftly laid down by Burr and Popper, while “Tiny\nLight” is a powerful song of resilience and hope during dark times.\n<br /><br />\n“Matt and Scott came up with the music for “Medicine” — the drum roll and that killer\nguitar hook — months before I came up with the lyrics or the vocal melody,” Grace\nexplains. “It gets across the emotion of somebody trying to steal your man away and\nthen fighting for what’s yours, getting back to a place where you’re in control. I picture\nmy adversary as a young Stevie Nicks, but with long black hair, who shows up, woos\neverybody and freaks me out, until I realize there is something I can do — then I step\nup and make my own magic.\n<br /><br />\n“When I wrote “Paris,” I was listening to the Kinks nonstop, and I was going for something\nwith a big, primal riff, like “You Really Got Me.” It was the first time I ever really\njust said, ‘I’m not going to try to tell a story, and I’m not going to try to communicate\nan emotion. I’m just going to say, basically, ‘I want to have sex right now.’” It’s my favorite\nsong to perform. That and “Medicine” are the sexiest, feistiest and the most fun of\nanything we’ve ever done.”\n<br /><br />\nPotter and her cohorts are equally captivating at the other end of the dynamic and\nthematic spectrum, on the zeitgeist-capturing widescreen ballad “Colors.” “I wrote it in\nNovember 2008, right after Obama was elected,” she says, “and there was a tingle in\nthe air. We were in St. Louis, which is a relatively conflicted city in terms of their political\nfeelings. We went to the zoo, and the cab driver on the way there was really angry\nand upset, but the cab driver on the way back to the hotel was listening to people\ntalking about the election on the radio with tears in his eyes. So that to me felt like\na moment in time that really needed to be captured, and I wanted to hold onto that\nmoment forever.”\nThough GPN initially made a name for themselves — and became a self-sufficient touring\nunit — on the jam-band circuit, the group’s sound was deeply rooted in the golden\nage of rock ’n’ roll; they cite Little Feat and J.J. Cale as huge influences early on. Burr\nand Potter formed the earliest version of the Nocturnals while both were students at St.\nLawrence University after he introduced her to the myriad joys of The Last Waltz. So it\nwas that the two soon-to-be bandmates and soulmates formed their bond while in the\nthrall of The Band, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison and Bob Dylan. All in all,\nnot a bad place to start.\n<br /><br />\nBecause of their ready acceptance on the U.S. touring circuit, they were able to regularly\nplay as many as 200 shows a year, shaping and sharpening their sound the\nold-fashioned way, on stages in front of demanding crowds. With the 2009 arrivals of\nPopper and Yurco the Nocturnals are entering the next phase of their evolution.\nThe current lineup came together with downright cosmic serendipity during the spring\nof 2009, when they were asked to cover some songs from the late ’60s for the VH1\ndocumentary Woodstock: Then and Now soon after the departure of their bass player.\nAfter accepting the invitation, Potter, Tournet and Burr went into scramble mode. At the\nsuggestion of a mutual friend, they contacted Popper, who agreed to join them for the\nsession as a one-off. Potter then impetuously threw out the idea that they bring down\nYurco from Vermont to add a second guitar.\n<br /><br />\nAs soon as they plugged in and started playing at New York’s Avatar Studios, blazing\nthrough the Airplane’s “White Rabbit,” Mitchell’s “Woodstock” and Janis Joplin’s “Try,” it\nwas dramatically apparent to all five musicians as well as those gathered in the control\nroom that something special was going on. Popper and Yurco didn’t just fit in, they\ncrushed it. After that beginning, there was no question that this lineup would be permanent.\nIt was as if the fates had insisted they come together.\n<br /><br />\nGrace, Matt and Scott were well aware of the North Carolina-born Popper, having seen\nher in action with Ryan Adams and the Cardinals. “We were just in awe of her the\nentire time,” says Grace. “She was like the hottest thing we’d ever seen.”\n<br /><br />\nLike Burr, Yurco is originally from New Jersey, where he started playing guitar at age\n10. Watching him play Keith Richards to Tournet’s Mick Taylor as the two guitarists work\ntheir way through complex and fiery extended passages onstage, shoulder-length hair\nflopping in front of his face, you soon come to understand the key role he plays in the\nNocturnals. “Joining this group was the greatest moment of my life,” says Yurco. “Gracie\nwrites great songs, Matty is an incredible drummer and Scotty is one of my favorite\nguitarists. I really dig the music, and I couldn’t be happier playing guitar in a band I\nreally appreciate.”\n<br /><br />\nThe band members are quick to credit Batson for enabling them to find themselves.\n“Our producer let us be ourselves and just play music together,” says Tournet. “I think\nwe hindered ourselves in some ways — we took some of the bite out of it on the first\ncouple of records. For whatever reasons we were scared to unleash the full thing…. I\ndon’t think we even realized what the full thing was. We’ve evolved into this monster,\nand Batson pulled the monster out of us.”\n<br /><br />\nWhat Batson has so vividly captured is a group of exceptional young players in the\nvery act of becoming themselves, as Grace puts it, on an album that is likely to surprise\nand delight even the band’s most devoted fans, as well as winning them a legion of\nnew ones. Over seven years and three albums, Grace Potter and the Nocturnals have\ngrown from an uncommonly bright and tasteful baby band into a force of nature, blowing\nthe roof off the sucker with seeming effortlessness. Make no mistake about it — this\nband has arrived.\n<br /><br />\n“Every record you make, you always say, ‘This is the one,’” says Matt. “But with this lineup\nwe’ve cracked the code. To get to this point we had to go through those records. It’s\nbeen a journey; Nothing but the Water was a fantastic time, going into a barn and\ngoing through our Neil Young Harvest/J.J. Cale moment, and This Is Somewhere was\nan incredible learning experience for us. The journey has culminated with this record.\nWe’ve all matured as musicians, and Benny and Catherine have made a huge difference.\nWe have the dream lineup, the dream sound, the dream producer — the whole\nfamily now is officially there.”\n<br /><br />\n“We were a homegrown Vermont band for five years,” says Grace with a wicked smile.\n“Now we’re a national act that does not want to be fucked with.” After pausing for dramatic\n(or comedic) effect, she continues in a more serious vein. “With this record we feel\nlike we’re finally there, after a long struggle. It’s like the song “Oasis,” which is about\nslogging through the desert feeling like you’re completely lost, with no end to the road\nand very little hope. I wrote it as advice to myself to keep on walking, because in the\nmiddle of the desert there might be an oasis. And that’s what we’ve actually found.”","hometown":"Waitsfield, Vermont","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/grace-potter-and-the-nocturnals","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"Grace Potter and the Nocturnals are like a modern-day version of\nTina Turner stroking the microphone in a spangled mini-dress while\nfronting the Rolling Stones circa Sticky Fingers.

After we’d made the record, Alison and I talked about the theme: there’s a lot about gender, about rela-tionships; it’s about sex – so, blood pressures’.\n<br /><br />\n‘Right now, I would say it's quite a dark record,’ says Alison Mosshart; ‘the lyr-ics are a little twisted.  I think I always say that about every record I do.  I think we're just both obsessive people. Obsessive about what we love and maybe even more obsessive about what we hate. I need to perform this record live to see what it really is, and what it's really communicating’.\n <br /><br />\nIn contrast to 2008’s “Midnight Boom”, the new album is a return to the band’s trademark dark guitar rock but with a twist. ‘The music’s changed be-cause Alison was on tour with The Dead Weather for much of last year,’ Jamie continues. ‘It was really freeing to take ideas of hers and to change them musi-cally. “The Last Goodbye” for instance changes from 4/4 to waltz time’. \n<br /><br />\n‘The Dead Weather is a very different kind of band,’ Alison agrees. ‘For one, it's a 4 piece band with a lot going on, and it's pretty spontaneous. I wasn't used to not knowing what was going to happen next on stage, having been so familiar performing with a drum machine. So I think I got better at using my voice as an instrument to make sounds and noise that could compete with gui-tars and feedback, rather than just delivering lyrics’.  \n<br /><br />\n“Blood Pressures” was recorded at Key Club Studios in Benton Harbor, Michi-gan. Jamie: ‘it was an absolute second home, with no distractions. I delved into sampling and programming. I spent a lot of time with drum kits. When we were recording the album, I visited a school band room: have you ever been to a band room in the US? They are absolutely huge, with walls of vari-ous kinds of drums. I sampled them all’.\n<br /><br />\n‘Programming the drums was really tedious to start with. If I wasn’t a control freak, I wouldn’t do it. But if I get started on something, I will obsess about it. I really like the techno feel. I really like all my emotions to come out in the gui-tar playing and it’s even better against a really rigid backbeat where there’s no speeding up or slowing down. I like that tension and I like the possibilities of where the drums can go’.\n<br /><br />\nThe sound of “Blood Pressures” is both technological and elemental: hypnotic, repetitive structures are augmented by C21 studio techniques, psychedelic touches and passionate vocals from Alison and Jamie. One song– “Nail In My Coffin” – features an early 70’s mellotron-style keyboard called an Optigan, from which the bass drum sound is sampled on much of the album: ‘it’s de-signed to sound like strings,’ says Jamie; ‘I just put these wind noises through a very vintage tape echo from 1965’.\n<br /><br />\nThe Kills’ working relationship is that of a real collaboration, with Alison and Jamie trading lyric lines, vocal parts – as on opener “Future Starts Slow” – as well as beats and melodies. ‘I’ve been in loads of bands and done my share of thinking too much about it,’ says Jamie. ‘But it’s better to free yourself up. Alison really helps me with that. I would definitely gravitate towards things taking too long, but she forces me to be more spontaneous’.\n\n‘Some days I think we're twins’ says Alison. ‘Some days I think we aren't simi-lar at all. We came together because we 'liked' the same things. We had so much in common on an art and music level. We are both quite impatient. We are both quite excitable, but Jamie is a perfectionist. He won't stop something until it's just the way he imagined it. I'm not like that. I love the moment, the snap shot, the accident. Oh, and I'm American, and he's English... so there's that’.  \n<br /><br />\nThis working relationship is exemplified by the two songs in the heart of the album, the exquisite ballad “Wild Charms” – sung by Jamie – and the brood-ing “DNA”, sung by Alison – both of which have the image of fire burning each other out. ‘Sometimes you sit down to write something and something else comes out. The two songs complement each other: “Wild Charms” is written from one point of view and “DNA” from another,’ says Alison. \n<br /><br />\n‘We've always written songs apart with the occasional song from start to finish together’ Alison says. ‘I suppose what I do is write melody and lyrics on an acoustic guitar, and then the songs like this that Jamie likes, he takes and transforms, gives them real music and form. With his own songs, he works them out from start to finish. He's quite tormented by his songs I think. I usu-ally don't hear them for awhile. He's very secretive. I try and help him with lyrics but often it's only a couple of missing lines I do’. \n<br /><br />\n‘The lyrics for “DNA” are Jamie's. The second he finished the last line, I was singing it in the studio. I think it was the last night of recording the album ac-tually. I love that song so much. “The Last Goodbye” is my lyrics: that song came out really quick.  It was one of those really natural songs to write that seemed to come out of nowhere. Jamie heard it and decided it would be best on an Optigan. He made it really special’. \n<br /><br />\nAlison’s lyrics are a revelation throughout, echoing old blues tropes and then taking them somewhere else. ‘How can I rely on my heart,’ she sings on “The Last Goodbye”, ‘if I break it with my own two hands’. Here defiant assertion quickly shades into brutal self-examination and candid admissions: ‘I am no better at this than you are’ (“Nail In My Coffin”).\n<br /><br />\n‘The blues are definitely an inspiration,’ she agrees: ‘I feel like every piece of music that I really love, and that really speaks to me is blues or has been in-spired by the blues somehow. I never get tired of the blues. I never feel dis-connected from the blues.\n<br /><br />\n‘Alison’s really prolific with lyrics, she’s got reels and reels of them,’ says Ja-mie. And she’s rooted in that type of music. ‘That’s the sound she likes. I came to it late. She’s still finding something new in the blues, and working with Jack White made it even more exciting for her. After “Midnight Boom” I was slightly frustrated and it’s a perfect antidote to racing round, thinking about trying to reproduce Compass Point and Grace Jones’.\n<br /><br />\nThis sense of continuity is fused with a thoroughly contemporary approach. Along with the techno flourishes – at the start of first single “Satellite” for in-stance – Jamie’s guitar sound has been heavily treated: ‘the guitar parts do sound quite processed. I used seven amps in different rooms, all with different frequencies, trying to get that brutal sound. I used octave pedals and very old gear – and it sounds a bit more futuristic’.\n<br /><br />\nAmong the artists that Jamie currently cites as an inspiration are Link Wray, Little Milton (‘the start of R&B’), Dave Bartholomew (Fats Domino’s arran-ger/ producer) and Captain Beefheart (‘he blew my mind when I was a teen-ager: I was gutted to hear the news when he died’). ‘And I’ve been listening to reggae: I got into it from Grace Jones, Sly and Robbie, and Peter Tosh. It was the last bastion of music that I hadn’t really delved into’.  Jamie’s love of reg-gae is clearly heard in the mutated rhythms of the album’s first single “Satel-lite”.\n<br /><br />\nAlthough very well-connected, The Kills are determined to pursue their own vision: as Jamie says about recording at Key Club in Michigan, with its lack of distractions, ‘That isolation was just great. You get absolutely high off playing music all days long. Being unaware of what’s going on in the rest of the world – I just love that’. \n<br /><br />\nAnd it is this uncompromising quality that has brought them testimonials from young groups.  Jamie’s reaction: ‘The XX citing us an influence. They want to meet US? That to me is quite phenomenal. We’ve given up quite a lot to do it our way. Some of our things work, others don’t. But there’s not too many bands that have that feeling, unfolding their music over six or seven al-bums. And there’s not that many labels who would support that.’","hometown":"London UK","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/the-kills","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"Dreamy and feverish, hooky and repetitive, obsessive and claustrophobic – that’s The Kills’ fourth album, “Blood Pressures”. ‘Obsessive and claustro-phobic?’ repeats Jamie Hince: ‘yes, I like that. After we’d made the record, Alison and I talked about the theme: there’s a lot about gender, about rela-tionships; it’s about sex – so, blood pressures’.\n<br /><br />\n‘Right now, I would say it's quite a dark record,’ says Alison Mosshart; ‘the lyr-ics are a little twisted.  I think I always say that about every record I do.  I think we're just both obsessive people. Obsessive about what we love and maybe even more obsessive about what we hate. I need to perform this record live to see what it really is, and what it's really communicating’.\n <br /><br />\nIn contrast to 2008’s “Midnight Boom”, the new album is a return to the band’s trademark dark guitar rock but with a twist. ‘The music’s changed be-cause Alison was on tour with The Dead Weather for much of last year,’ Jamie continues. ‘It was really freeing to take ideas of hers and to change them musi-cally. “The Last Goodbye” for instance changes from 4/4 to waltz time’. \n<br /><br />\n‘The Dead Weather is a very different kind of band,’ Alison agrees. ‘For one, it's a 4 piece band with a lot going on, and it's pretty spontaneous. I wasn't used to not knowing what was going to happen next on stage, having been so familiar performing with a drum machine. So I think I got better at using my voice as an instrument to make sounds and noise that could compete with gui-tars and feedback, rather than just delivering lyrics’.  \n<br /><br />\n“Blood Pressures” was recorded at Key Club Studios in Benton Harbor, Michi-gan. Jamie: ‘it was an absolute second home, with no distractions. I delved into sampling and programming. I spent a lot of time with drum kits. When we were recording the album, I visited a school band room: have you ever been to a band room in the US? They are absolutely huge, with walls of vari-ous kinds of drums. I sampled them all’.\n<br /><br />\n‘Programming the drums was really tedious to start with. If I wasn’t a control freak, I wouldn’t do it. But if I get started on something, I will obsess about it. I really like the techno feel. I really like all my emotions to come out in the gui-tar playing and it’s even better against a really rigid backbeat where there’s no speeding up or slowing down.

Started as a recording project in 2008, Disappears inevitably left the studio - supporting Wire, Deerhunter, Tortoise, German legends Cluster and beyond. \n<br /><br />\nInitially designed to explore the simplicity of early American music and it's reinterpretation by UK acts of the mid 80's, founding member's Brian Case (The Ponys) and Graeme Gibson (Boas, Fruit Bats) started recording demos in search of something familiar but exciting. Eventually the tapes were passed onto Jonathan van Herik (Boas) and new comer Damon Carruesco, completing the group's line up. Throughout 2008 the band self released a series of 7\" singles and a live album, signing to the Kranky imprint in 2009. Their debut album Lux was released in the spring of 2010. Sans a few early champions, Lux was initially met with little fanfare and went largely unnoticed. Dark and hazy, it showed the band experimenting with minimal arrangements married to the attitude of bands like Suicide and The Fall. \n<br /><br />\nA series of US tours followed, the band cris crossing the states playing to small but enthusiastic crowds.

Started as a recording project in 2008, Disappears inevitably left the studio - supporting Wire, Deerhunter, Tortoise, German legends Cluster and beyond. \n<br /><br />\nInitially designed to explore the simplicity of early American music and it's reinterpretation by UK acts of the mid 80's, founding member's Brian Case (The Ponys) and Graeme Gibson (Boas, Fruit Bats) started recording demos in search of something familiar but exciting. Eventually the tapes were passed onto Jonathan van Herik (Boas) and new comer Damon Carruesco, completing the group's line up. Throughout 2008 the band self released a series of 7\" singles and a live album, signing to the Kranky imprint in 2009. Their debut album Lux was released in the spring of 2010. Sans a few early champions, Lux was initially met with little fanfare and went largely unnoticed. Dark and hazy, it showed the band experimenting with minimal arrangements married to the attitude of bands like Suicide and The Fall. \n<br /><br />\nA series of US tours followed, the band cris crossing the states playing to small but enthusiastic crowds.

For an album entirely recorded in Mr and Mrs Macfarlane’s garage, it made a serious impact, selling over 200,000 copies and picking up a fistful of Brit Award and Mercury nominations along the way. The band’s appeal spanned everyone from indie kids to clubbers to the highest strata of the fashion world – the band were handpicked by Gucci to soundtrack a worldwide campaign, covering Depeche Mode’s Strangelove for an advert created by acclaimed director Frank Miller (Sin City, The Spirit).\n<br /><br />\nMost importantly they have watched their global audience grow exponentially as their live shows become ever more spectacular. Two sold out dates at London’s 2500 capacity Kentish Town Forum found the band transforming a normally rather drab venue into a Brazilian carnival. Friendly Fires’ all-night club events sprang up where the trio would be joined by guests like Hot Chips’ Joe Goddard, Danilo Plessow’s Detroit-centric Motor City Drum Ensemble and Kompakt Records boss, Michael Mayer.\n<br /><br />\nOf course, one day, the touring and the promotion ended and the band realised they had to make a new record, prove themselves all over again. How would they do that?\n<br /><br />\n“We’re not the sort of band who write songs in sound-checks or on the back of the tour bus,” laughs Ed. “You think you’ll be really inspired by touring, all these mad places you visit, but that’s a myth really. Well it is for me. When we came off tour I remember thinking, ‘I hope I can still write songs...’”\n<br /><br />\nSo in October 2009 Friendly Fires began to piece together the ideas and themes that would become their new record, Pala.  They began in a basement studio in Shoreditch called, with admirable candour, The Basement, but London’s ever-present distractions kept them from really focusing, so in January 2010 they moved operations back to their original home, Ed’s parent’s garage in St Alban’s.\n<br /><br />\nAs soon as the band let go and began to work “bizarre hours” Pala began to take shape. The shifting, shuffling Chimes took serious shape, as did the Afro-beat pop explosion of Pull Me Back To Earth. The brilliantly frenetic True Love soon appeared and was, with its slap-bass and shimmery guitars, clearly and immediately, a very Friendly Fires sort of song. “Once we were away from everything we were fine,” Jack says. “Because all we were left with were our ideas.”\n<br /><br />\nAnd what ideas they were. Camera shutters, guitar lines inspired by old Hawaiian records, ancient home-recorded cassettes, bells ringing and bird-song all appeared as endlessly manipulated samples as the songs were, in classic Friendly Fires manner, painstakingly built up piece by piece. \n<br /><br />\nWhen the garage became too crowded Ed took himself off to a rented seafront house in out-of-season Rye to work on melodies and lyrics. “Mine was the only house on the whole street that was occupied,” he says. “I was forced into being creative.”\n<br /><br />\nLast autumn, as Edd and Jack worked on songs, Ed packed up again and drove a van all the way to a converted barn in Yvetot in the far north of Upper Normandy. This would be where the album’s lyrical themes would really develop. \n<br /><br />\n“It was miles from the nearest neighbour,” Ed says. “It was quite scary actually – the place was haunted. No television, no internet, no central heating. I had to get firewood every day. It was very rustic…”\n<br /><br />\nBut the barn’s isolation worked brilliantly. \n<br /><br />\n“It exaggerated all my emotions,” Ed says. “Which is great for songwriting. A lot of the songs on this record are about rejection and loneliness, my own search for what really is true love?”\n<br /><br />\nThree weeks in Ed was getting cabin fever and jumped a train to Rouen. When he got back to he wrote the broken-hearted, disco-scented Running Away, which is all about being afraid of admitting your feelings for someone close to you. It’s still one of his favourites.\n<br /><br />\nThe trick Pala pulls of so wonderfully is making the melancholic sound so euphoric, putting Ed’s worried words up against the brightest, toughest music they’ve ever made. Show Me Lights is spectacular, with a real Hollywood sheen, yet still massively heavy, pure pop. \n<br /><br />\n“I feel nostalgic for that mid-to-late 90s, hip-hop meets chart pop meets RnB sort of music,” Ed says. “I love those N-Sync or Backstreet Boys records, tough hi-tech pop with hugely detailed production. And slamming percussion too. Having said that I probably hated it at the time!” \n<br /><br />\n“But that era of pop music does feel like it had more soul,” Edd nods. “Nowadays you hear the same synth sounds on everything – it all feels soulless and sterile.\n<br /><br />\nEd, Edd and Jack talk with great enthusiasm about Talking Heads, Tom Tom Club, Timbaland and Scritti Politti, artists who made brilliant pop records with a sense of otherness, but also of the genius techno of Carl Craig and Boards of Canada too.\n“It’s those odd chords,” Jack says. “That edge of romance and nostalgia – music with heartbreak but not melodrama.”\n<br /><br />\n“It’s about honesty,” Ed says. “A lot of house and disco music has simplistic lyrics, they’re not trying to be clever, like indie music so often is. That cleverness doesn’t appeal to me – I like dancing to music where someone tells you something real, ‘I need your love!’ That’s a million times better than someone being clever.\n<br /><br />\nThe title track was inspired by Aldous Huxley’s 1962 novel, Island.\n<br /><br />\n“I liked the idea of this utopian society where everyone gets along but it all fails anyway,” laughs Ed. “The idea that paradise is temporary and you must enjoy it while you can really applies to my life – and to most people I know. A doomed utopia is a great symbol for music!”\n<br /><br />\nSo, three years later, Friendly Fires can’t wait to get back into it. They feel 2011 is a great year for the record, after music’s minimalistic wallowing of the last couple of years. The band have now been playing together for half their lives, so another long stint on the road together holds no fears. “We argue and get heated about things, but it’s not an ego war,” laughs Edd. “We can disagree without it becoming a fist fight.”\n<br /><br />\nAnd after amazing shows in New York, Australia and Japan they are ready to take this brilliant new record to the rest of the world.\n<br /><br />\n“It’s daunting,” Ed says. “But we’re ready for it. The truth is, there’s just not enough music out there that’s really celebratory.”","hometown":"St Albans,","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/friendly-fires","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"\"If we had an manifesto for this album\" says Friendly Fires’ singer and bass-player Ed Macfarlane, \"it was a simple one; make an exciting, colourful pop record\"\n<br /><br />\n“Our goal is to make vibrant, widescreen songs” adds guitarist Edd Gibson. “but they must retain a spontaneity, have an energy and mysticism around them.”\n<br /><br />\n“We try really hard to focus on making everything sound as spontaneous and fun and off the cuff as possible,” nods Ed.\n<br /><br />\n“Only we spend months doing it,” deadpans drummer Jack Savidge.\n<br /><br />\nIt has been three years since Friendly Fires released their self-titled debut album.

It sounds like where they're from: Childhood friends Ritzy Bryan (vocals, guitar) and Rhydian Dafydd (bass, vocals) grew up in rural North Wales, surrounded by rolling green hills and little else. \"There's a beauty and a loneliness to the landscape there,\" says Dafydd. \"We had no neighbors growing up,\" Bryan notes. \"I think my parents looked for a house with no neighbors so they could play their music as loud as possible.\"\n<br /><br />\nFor her part, Bryan loved the isolation. Growing up as an only child, the singer immersed herself in her parents' enormous record collection and the classical guitar studies she took on at the age of seven. \"I loved playing guitar by myself, back then I was quite introverted with my music,\" she says.\n<br /><br />\nBryan and Dafydd had been writing music separately from one another, and worked together in a couple of short-lived local bands after finishing school. They knew they wanted to collaborate, but didn't manage to make it work until a few years ago. \"We kept missing each other,\" Ritzy says. Bryan went off to Washington, D.C \"on a whim\" and returned to Wales in 2008 with renewed focus. \"My family situation wasn't easy to go back to\" says Bryan. \"I came back out of necessity and found a lot of sanctuary recording with Rhydian and having this new band to concentrate on.\"\n<br /><br />\nFor six months, the pair wrote together, experimenting with different sonic approaches. \"We'd go for walks in the hills between recordings,\" Dafydd remembers. \"We'd write for hours and hours,\" adds Bryan, \"and if we got frustrated, we'd go stomp it out, up and down the mountains.\" But as the sessions began yielding signature tunes like \"Austere\" and \"Cradle\" - tracks that combined the duo's interest in thick, textured noises with clear, shimmering pop hooks - they knew they'd found their sound. \"We'd always been into writing strong melodies,\" Bryan says. \"The sparks really flew when we started messing with things that were choral and symphonic, mixed with what both of us had already enjoyed separately: dirty, loud, rhythmic guitars and thick bass-lines.\"\n<br /><br />\nThe Joy Formidable released \"Austere\" in July 2008, followed by \"Cradle\" on double 7\" later that summer, and quickly produced an eight-track EP, A Balloon Called Moaning, which they released themselves in the U.K. in early 2009. Having relocated to London and recruited drummer Matthew Thomas, the trio quickly earned a reputation for blistering live performances. \"We love and encourage the beautiful double-pedal,\" says Bryan, with a chuckle. \"We do lean towards a slightly metal aesthetic when it comes to drums, which makes it very loud and heavy and all the things we want to be as a live entity. The new album definitely explores those elements, and that's because of Matt being in the band.\"\n<br /><br />\nThe trio spent 2009 touring the U.K., Europe and Australia with bands including Editors, Temper Trap and Passion Pit, mastering tiny clubs and festival stages alike. Their introduction to American audiences came early this year, when Passion Pit invited The Joy Formidable to open a pair of sold-out shows at New York's Terminal 5. In late April, they teamed with a new label started by Passion Pit's Ayad Al Adhamy, Black Bell Records, to release A Balloon Called Moaning in the U.S. The New York Times' Jon Pareles praised the EP's \"cryptic lyrics that glint with urgency,\" and said that \"the music regenerates the turbulent haze of 1990s rock, but it's less tormented and more anthemic, confident of the pop structures at its core.\" They've also earned critical raves from NME, The Guardian, the London Times, Spin and Pitchfork, heavy rotation on Sirius XM's indie rock channel, Sirius XMU, and praise from Garbage's Shirley Manson and Courtney Love, among others. This summer, The Joy Formidable signed with Canvasback/Atlantic Records, and will release their debut album for the label, The Big Roar, early next year. \n<br /><br />\nWhen they weren't on the road, the band worked on writing and tracking the material for The Big Roar. \"We recorded in a tiny corner of our London bedroom\" Bryan says. \"It was great, because you could capture that moment when you wake up in the middle of the night with a melody or an image or a lyric.\" Working on and off for a year, The Joy Formidable crafted a remarkable collection of modern rock songs that explore what Bryan describes as \"the possibility of victory in a hopeless situation.” Adds Dafydd: \"The album covers a lot of emotional range. It's captured the battle between the eternal optimist and the manic depressive.\"\n<br /><br />\nThey produced The Big Roar themselves - with help from engineer Neak Menter - and traveled to Los Angeles this summer to mix it with producer Rich Costey (Muse, Foo Fighters, Glasvegas). A single from those sessions, \"I Don't Want To See You Like This,\" is due out this autumn, with the full-length to follow in early 2011.\n<br /><br />\nThe Joy Formidable will headline the Emerge NME Radar tour in September and October, making stops at various venues throughout the UK, and return to the U.S. for a headlining run in November.","hometown":"Wales ","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/the-joy-formidable","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"There's something panoramic about The Joy Formidable's music - their mountainous, fuzzed out riffs and ferocious, earthy rhythms shrouded in ethereal haze.

Holed up in a synagogue in East London, he had little to begin with — a few fragments, a sketch for a 10-minute song that resembled Street Hassle, and a set of lyrics begun on a New Year's Day train from Wales to London. But what little there was seemed to suggest the beginnings of something quite special, something markedly different to the songs they had written before.\n<br /><br />\nThe continued maturation of Noah and the Whale has been a pleasing thing to follow — from the joyous burst of their debut, Peaceful, the World Lays Me Down, through the lovelorn sobriety of The First Days of Spring, it now reaches a kind of fruition on Last Night on Earth.\n<br /><br />\nWhere The First Days of Spring was a contained and inward-looking record that moved at near-underwater speed, Last Night on Earth possesses a curiosity and a vibrancy, a romance and a restlessness, and a clutch of songs that mark out Fink as not just as one of the best songwriters of his generation, but also as a supremely gifted storyteller. These are tales of youth and ageing, of optimism and running away, as well of failure and pride. “And it feels like his new life can start,” runs the chorus of No Distance Is Too Far. “And it feels like heaven.”\n<br /><br />\nThe album's strong narrative thread was in part inspired by Lou Reed's 1973 album Berlin as well as Tom Waits' 1992 record Bone Machine, and a little Arthur Russell thrown in for good measure. “Just people songs,” is how Fink describes it. “These are simple stories, so you could tell them in hundreds of different ways, and the way you tell them, that's sort of the music.”\n<br /><br />\nThe way he tells them is at times broad-skied and anthemic — particularly on tracks such as L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N and Tonight's The Kind Of Night, while at others there are strokes of unabashed pop — Life Is Life, for example, or Just Me Before We Met. And at others still, such as on final track Old Joy, there is a sweet kind of wistfulness. Lyrically, they range from the nostalgic to the vital, songs charged with an urgency, a sense of movement, and an appetite for adventure and the unknown. It is, in many senses, a true coming of age record.\n<br /><br />\n“I don't think that coming of age thing has been in anything I've done before,” Fink says. “But from the beginning I wanted to write a record that had that excitement of being young and being in the night. I think it's that naivity — that feeling that things are happening everywhere except where you are, wondering what's out there in the wide world. It's when you're on a bus, you don't know where you're heading, you don't know what's at the end of it, and you have this fantasy that whatever's at the end of it is going to be remarkable and magnificent.”\n<br /><br />\nCertainly Noah and the Whale as a band now seem to have come of age. As the leaders of the same British folk-rock scene that spawned Laura Marling, Mumford & Sons, and Emmy the Great, with this album they appear to stand perhaps a little taller and a little broader than their peers; these songs possess a maturity, and a new kind of wisdom: “Tall buildings and a wife won't be enough for me,” Fink sings on Old Joy. “There is more in the world to be found than dreams.”\n<br /><br />\nThe personnel shifted a little for Last Night on Earth. Drummer Doug Fink left the band last year to concentrate on his medical career. “He's my older brother, and there's so many roles he fulfils on the road, not just the drummer, so it's kind of hard,” Fink says of his absence. “But he's the first person I go to if I need to consult someone, if I need someone's opinion, so he's still been a big part of this record … And I think he will come back eventually.”\n<br /><br />\nCo-produced by Fink and Jason Lader [Julian Casablancas, The Mars Volta] in Los Angeles, Last Night on Earth features backing vocals by Jen Turner from Here We Go Magic, and gospel vocals by the legendary Waters Sisters, who famously provided backing vocals for Michael Jackson's Wanna Be Starting Something. “I was teaching them the vocals for Old Joy,” Fink recalls. “One of the sisters came in and asked for a latte with six sugars – six sugars! — and she downed that, went in and gave the best vocal take I've ever heard.”  Elsewhere, the record features Adam MacDougall of The Black Crowes on Moog and Rhodes, and legendary percussionist Lenny Castro.\n<br /><br />\nThere is a strong cinematic element to Last Night on Earth — from the deliberately Twin Peaks air of Wild Thing to the album's cast of richly-drawn characters. In part this was fed by Fink's experience of directing the short film that accompanied The First Days of Spring. “Film is such a different writing process, it infiltrates the way I write songs,” he explains. “And a lot of them I imagined as scenes — Tonight's the Kind of Night I imagined as this guy running away from home and getting on a bus…”\n<br /><br />\nIt is also a richly poetic record: last year, Fink read the work of Frank O'Hara for the first time, and fell in love with his poem Having A Coke With You. “I wanted Life Is Life to have a feel of that, or a tempo. Just the notion of it. Having A Coke With You is I think a very romantic poem, and that's the only outwardly romantic song on the album, and so I wanted it to have the same approach.”\n<br /><br />\nThe album's title is also a nod towards Charles Bukowski's poetry collection The Last Night of the Earth — Fink says he was attracted to the sense of “loser's pride” in Bukowski's work. “In my head,” he says, “there is a link between Lou Reed's Berlin, and Bukowski's poetry.” The track Life Is Life, is another Bukowski reference, its title tipping its hat to his poem The Laughing Heart — a poem whose final lines seem to sum up this record quite perfectly: “Your life is your life,” it runs. “Know it while you have it. You are marvellous. The Gods wait to delight in you.”","hometown":"London UK","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/noah-and-the-whale","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"In the early January of last year, Charlie Fink set to work on Noah and the Whale's third album.

In part this was fed by Fink's experience of directing the short film that accompanied The First Days of Spring. “Film is such a different writing process, it infiltrates the way I write songs,” he explains. “And a lot of them I imagined as scenes — Tonight's the Kind of Night I imagined as this guy running away from home and getting on a bus…”\n<br /><br />\nIt is also a richly poetic record: last year, Fink read the work of Frank O'Hara for the first time, and fell in love with his poem Having A Coke With You. “I wanted Life Is Life to have a feel of that, or a tempo. Just the notion of it. Having A Coke With You is I think a very romantic poem, and that's the only outwardly romantic song on the album, and so I wanted it to have the same approach.”\n<br /><br />\nThe album's title is also a nod towards Charles Bukowski's poetry collection The Last Night of the Earth — Fink says he was attracted to the sense of “loser's pride” in Bukowski's work. “In my head,” he says, “there is a link between Lou Reed's Berlin, and Bukowski's poetry.” The track Life Is Life, is another Bukowski reference, its title tipping its hat to his poem The Laughing Heart — a poem whose final lines seem to sum up this record quite perfectly: “Your life is your life,” it runs. “Know it while you have it. You are marvellous. The Gods wait to delight in you.”","musicbrainz_id":null}},"category":"Music","end_time":"Sun, 07 Aug 2011 15:15:00 -0500","google_date":"20110807T193000Z/20110807T201500Z","title":"Noah & The Whale","updated_at":"2011-06-15 13:05:05 -0500","conference_category":null,"time":"02:30 PM","date":"Sunday 08/07/11","id":"462364","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/event/2011/08/07/noah-the-whale","photo_thumb_small":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14914/sq_44.jpg","start_time":"Sun, 07 Aug 2011 14:30:00 -0500"},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14884/sq_90.JPG","votes":"7779","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/events/462365.json","bands":{"band":{"display_date":"2011-08-07","photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14884/sq_90.JPG","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14884/original.JPG","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/32433.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"21","location":"Lineup - Main","tier":"4"}},"main_lineup_position":"46","facebook_url":"http://www.facebook.com/floggingmolly","twitter_username":"_floggingmolly","setlist":null,"title":"Flogging Molly","updated_at":"2011-05-05 19:44:56 -0500","youtube_id":"1yf9cW6RK6A","similar_bands":{"similar_band":[{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/40203.json","title":"The Kills"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/58507.json","title":"Fitz & The Tantrums"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/59792.json","title":"Imelda May"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/197512.json","title":"Black Lips"}]},"flickr_tag":"floggingmolly","id":"32433","echonest_id":"ARP6IJB1187B9B14DE","homepage":"http://www.floggingmolly.com","myspace_link":null,"fan_count":"8277","description":"The lights have gone out on many Americans. Three years ago, working class America was under the assumption that their nest eggs were secure, their homes were their safest investments and that the economy was on the upswing. Then, with virtually no warning, their lives were upturned, lifelong dreams and plans were dashed, and neighbors began to turn on one another because of political disagreement. It all happened with the Speed of Darkness.\n<br /><br /> \nThe creation of Flogging Molly's new record, Speed of Darkness, was anything but business as usual for the band. “It wasn’t the album we set out to write,” vocalist/guitarist Dave King says. “It became the album we had to write.”   Musically and lyrically, Flogging Molly has never sounded so mature or rousing, nor have the messages of alienation and hope behind their songs ever been so relevant. Speed of Darkness was written over several months when the band would descend into the basement of King’s Detroit home—a home he shares with his wife, Flogging Molly fiddler, Bridget Regan (they maintain dual residences in Ireland and Detroit, where Bridget was born and raised).  As the country struggled to stay afloat, the songs evolved into odes to the working man and battle cries against the elite establishment that so quickly and callously cast him aside.  “I write from my surroundings,” King says. “I wanted people who’ve lost their jobs to know I was paying attention.  We’re singing for them, all of these good people brought to their knees.” Nowhere is this more apparent than on the charging and bluesy track “The Power’s Out.”\n<br /><br />\nWith Speed of Darkness, the band went into unchartered territory.  The album was recorded at Echo Mountain Recording Studio, which is housed in a converted church in Asheville, North Carolina.  The setting underscored a record that continually asks hard questions of faith and suffering, of belief and deliverance. “We liked making music in a building that had been a voice for the community,” King says. “We just wanted to sing a little louder than they had before.” And sing louder they did. Songs like “A Prayer for Me in Silence” and “The Cradle of Humankind” are journeys through hardship and heartache, through besieged homelands and losses that open like chasms. Other tracks like “This Present State of Grace” and “Oliver Boy” are songs of searching, of country and democracy, songs that bear witness to the glory and terror of being human.  Speed of Darkness also marks the debut of Flogging Molly’s own record label Borstal Beat, which they founded after a great run with SideOneDummy, their home for the last decade.  The new chapter in the band’s life also makes perfect sense: they’re more independent than ever, more themselves than ever.  “We’re more serious now and we’re taking risks.  It’s who Flogging Molly is,” King says.\n<br /><br />\nFlogging Molly has never conformed to industry tastes; they’ve always been the outcasts who put their fans before commercial success, and they’ve always put their music before marketability.  The rewards of such independence and integrity are undeniable on Speed of Darkness. You feel it from the first note to the last, the pathos and the passion, the sweeping and rollicking electricity of inspiration. \n<br /><br />\nFounded in Los Angeles in 1997, Flogging Molly has always defied categorization. The infectious originality of their songs is a badge of honor and key to the band’s creativity, their urgency. They infuse punk rock with Celtic instruments—violin, mandolin and the accordion—and they merge blues progressions with grinding guitars and traditional Irish music, the music of King’s youth.  “We're not a traditional band,\" explains Dublin-born King. \"We are influenced by traditional music and inspired by it, but without question we put our own twist on it.\"  Theirs is music of exile and rebellion, of struggle and history and protest. It’s music of a country torn down the middle; a deeply beautiful and wounded country that knows no quit, and Flogging Molly pays homage to that resolve in every note.  \n<br /><br />\nFlogging Molly’s fans have always appreciated the social and political awareness driving the music.  Swagger, the band’s first album, transcended everyone’s expectations in 2000, and the track “The Worst Day Since Yesterday” was included in the film Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Drunken Lullabies was released in 2002 and certified Gold. In 2004, the band released Within a Mile of Home, and in 2008, Flogging Molly put out Float, a deeply stirring and personal album recorded in King’s native Ireland.  No surprise that Float found the band’s widest audience yet.  Through all of this, Flogging Molly—first, last, and always a live band—was touring, playing raucous and adrenaline-fueled shows in bars, pubs, and nearly every major rock festival in North America, Europe, and Japan. “In Ireland,” King says, “you go to the pub to have a conversation.  That’s what we do every night on stage, go to the ‘pub’ and trade stories.” In 2010, to showcase their unparalleled and limitless energy on stage, the band released Flogging Molly: Live at the Greek Theatre, a three disc set chronicling their legendary sold out shows at one of LA’s most famous music venues. \n<br /><br />\nSpeed Of Darkness is music to play after you’ve lost your job or your love, and music to listen to as you dream of better things for your family and country.  It’s the music you hear as you fight a bigger man, and it’s the music you hear as you help him from the floor and buy him a pint at the bar.  The album, like Flogging Molly itself, is a testament to youth and resilience, to growing old and the wisdom of scars, and yet for all of the record’s darkness and the speed with which it descends, the ultimate theme is one of light: We can persevere.

His driving foresight is constantly pushing the technological boundaries of his stage show. In May 2010 he unveiled the visual orgy of the cube stage and his highly anticipated L.E.D ‘mau5ehead’. The year climaxed with a 17,000 capacity sell out show at London’s Earls Court. He is the first ever electronic artist to headline the legendary venue.  Additionally the dancefloor icon's multi award winning albums have seen him achieve that rare balance,  appealing to both the clubbing cognoscenti and musical masses.\n<br><br>\nZimmerman grew up in Niagara Falls, Ontario, near Toronto. As a kid he was obsessed with computers and started making chip tunes as a teenager. “They’re musical compositions made using the chips from old computers,” he explains. Soon, his chip tunes attracted the attention of the Los Angeles nu metal community which resulted in him contributing to Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee’s 1999 album Methods Of Mayhem. The unlikely duo remain friends as well as collaborators; in 2009 they released two electro house singles — Chicken and Redic  — under the name W.T.F.?, while they also reunited to play at Miami’s Ultra Music Festival in 2010.\n<br><br>\nIt was around this time that Zimmerman became involved with a low-budget dance music radio show in Niagara Falls called The Party Revolution. “Back then, cutting edge dance music in Niagara Falls meant Babylon Zoo,” he laughs. His job was “technical whizz kid”. In other words, he was the one who knew how to use a computer. “All those guys were interested in was recording two turntables onto a computer and burning off a CD so they could send it the radio station,” he explains. “I learnt about digital audio and making music on computers and new editing techniques. Every new bit of technology that was released to do with making music, I was on top of it. They were still dinosauring it out playing on turntables.”\n<br><br>\nWhen he tried to convince local recording studios that they needed to embrace computers at the turn of the millennium, no-one was interested. “They had an old school approach to recording music. They were really in denial about that kind of thing. It was rocket science to them. They didn’t get it.” Zimmerman did. Eventually he managed to convince a small studio in Toronto to let him install new technology and he helped to record numerous local bands.\n<br><br>\nWhile earning his dance music stripes, Zimmerman worked as a web developer. Together with long-term collaborator Steve Duda, Zimmerman writes music making software, including one of the programmes he uses in his live show which he describes it as “like a drum sequencer and sample player on crack”. Evolving music technology’s cutting edge, deadmau5 worked for FL Studios, the company behind Fruity Loops, and contributed to the development of an iPhone app called Touch Mix, which allows you to mix tracks on your mobile.\n<br><br>\nZimmerman says that his dream at the time was to be a producer, working on other people’s music. He wrote his own material as a hobby. “IDM (intelligent dance music) like Aphex Twin,” he says. “Nothing to do with the kind of thing I make now.”&nbsp;His first proper release started out as a joke. It was called This Is The Hook, written together with Duda under the name B.S.O.D. (which stands for ‘blue screen of death’, jargon for the dreaded Windows error message). They took a house beat and added a digitised voice explaining what was happening. They considered it to be a hilarious parody of the formulaic extreme of dance music; what they hadn’t counted on was it going to #1 on the Beatport chart in 2006.\n<br><br>\nB.S.O.D. crafted an entire album and remixed Hurt by Christina Aguilera, but the money ran out and Duda had to return to L.A. “We may do some more B.S.O.D. stuff in the future,” says Zimmerman. “And we’re still working on software together.”&nbsp;One of the first things Zimmerman wrote after Duda’s departure was Faxing Berlin. He released it under the moniker deadmau5, using the same name as his one-man web developing business, which itself was named after a dead mouse he found in his computer (the unusual alphanumeric spelling is so it can function as a user name for online chat-rooms). He sent Faxing Berlin to Chris Lake, who passed it to Pete Tong, who played it on his Radio 1 show. The subsequent exposure turned it into one of the biggest records of 2007. The fusion of trance chords and house beats spawned a series of imitators. “It was quite a buzz to know that I’d influenced the course of dance music,” says Zimmerman with a smile. In 2008, deadmau5 was the biggest selling artist on Beatport.\n<br><br>\nZimmerman’s next masterstroke was to rework his image. Part of the deadmau5 logo was a grinning mouse head with oversized ears, which he decided to turn into a mask. The first time he wore it at a club, the audience were stunned. “I remember putting it on and looking out of the visor and seeing everyone in utter bewilderment,” he says. “They were like, ‘Who is this guy? Is he for real?’ But they warmed up to it real fast. When the lights came on in the helmet and they started blinking to the beat, the place went crazy.”\n<br><br>\nHe wore a crystal encrusted variant of the mouse head to the Grammy Awards, where he was nominated for Best Remixed Recording for his take on The Longest Road by Californian house producer Morgan Page. “Even though no one knew who I was, as I was walking up the red carpet, all these reporters and TV crews were stopping me. In the end I actually missed the award because it took so long.\n<br><br>\nIn 2009, he cracked the UK single chart when I Remember hit #14. This was followed by his second artist compilation album, For Lack Of A Better Name, which compiled the best of his single releases from the previous twelve months.
