If so, then it’s hard to imagine a band pushing that manifesto further than Cults. On the surface they could be sickly sweet – a smitten duo called Brian Oblivion and Madeline Follin who spin gorgeous melodies across their girl group-inspired bedroom pop. But dig deeper and a whole new world opens up, one that contains songs about apprehension, substance abuse and the pain of moving from adolescence into adulthood. Oh, and those inspirational, moving speeches that appear, ghost-like, behind the music? They’re from a selection of notorious cult leaders …\n <br /><br />\n“I think what makes something beautiful is when it’s pretty but there’s something wrong with it too,” muses Brian. “So where our music is upbeat and uplifting, behind that there are heartbreaking lyrics and quotes from Charles Manson, Patty Hearst, Jim Jones … I wanted quotes of ugly people saying beautiful things. That’s the pinnacle of beauty to me, when someone who is so obviously disagreeable in every way can say something perfect.”\n <br /><br />\nThe Cults story is really one of chance meetings, chances so fortuitous you may wonder if something stronger – something more like fate – was at work. How else to explain the fact that Madeline happened to be in San Diego, Brian’s hometown, and the two happened to be in attendance at the same concert with a mutual friend. How else to explain the fact that, for some unknown reason, Madeline had left half her belongings in San Francisco, prompting Brian to offer to drive the round trip to collect them, during which the pair would cement their relationship by bonding over each other’s iPod collection (from Lesley Gore and Jay-Z to Justin Timberlake). And how else to explain the fact that Madeline and Brian both happened to be embarking on a imminent move to New York to study film, ensuring that they spend endless hours of time together and Brian got the chance to hear Madeline singing over the first songs he'd ever written. \n <br /><br />\nThrilled but shy about their new recordings, the pair tentatively put them up on a Bandcamp page in February 2010 and gave the tracks to a few friends under the stipulation that they don’t share them. Fortunately their friends didn’t always obey orders and “Go Outside” found it’s way to music blog Gorilla Vs Bear who posted the unknown demo to a roaring reception. More fate, you might say. And here’s some more – Gorilla Vs Bear just so happened to be starting up a label, Forest Family Records, and were looking for an undiscovered new band to launch it with.\n<br /><br />\nIn April of 2010 Cults released a “Go Outside” 7” single with Forest Family that sold out before the copies even went to print. Over the next several months the band would release a few more tracks from these early recordings, record a track called “Oh My God” for Adult Swims single series, build on the true nature of their musical desires and evangelize new listeners nationwide.\n<br /><br />\nAfter a few standout performances last fall at the 2010 CMJ Festival in which music’s elite praised the duos’ simplistic pop charm, Cults decided their next move would be to put a full album out with a bigger label and signed to the newly-created Sony imprint ITNO. The band’s self-titled release is – like the original demos – self-produced, although engineer Shane Stoneback (Sleigh Bells, Vampire Weekend) was brought on board to tighten things up. A love of hip hop is also evident in their use of repetition: “We wanted the melody to be the thing that breaks the music out of its monotony,” says Brian. “In that sense some of our songs aren’t far off from early Wu Tang stuff where they’d sample soul records.”\n <br /><br />\nThat all this happened for Cults in the space of a year says a lot about the band's sense of spontaneity. And the fact that most people didn't know the first thing about them when they heard their music? That just worked to their advantage – especially as a sense of mystery and intrigue has been absent from rock’n’roll for too long.\n <br /><br />\n“Bands have become way too handy at promoting themselves,” says Brian. “There’s nothing left to ponder if there is too much information – you can just consume it and throw it away.”\n<br /><br />\nAnd as for why the band chose the name Cults: “A lot of our songs are about what we’re going through right now – the fear of growing up and facing adult responsibility,” says Brian. “And in a way that fear is what makes people join cults in the first place – wanting to escape competition and success and be a part of something bigger, communal. We also want to live our own lives with our own schedules and expectations, so in a way this band has become our own cult.”","hometown":null,"link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/cults","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"It’s often said that the most subversive pop music – from the Shangri Las to Rihanna – is that which wraps sinister tales within a sugar-coated shell.

They’re from a selection of notorious cult leaders …\n <br /><br />\n“I think what makes something beautiful is when it’s pretty but there’s something wrong with it too,” muses Brian. “So where our music is upbeat and uplifting, behind that there are heartbreaking lyrics and quotes from Charles Manson, Patty Hearst, Jim Jones … I wanted quotes of ugly people saying beautiful things. That’s the pinnacle of beauty to me, when someone who is so obviously disagreeable in every way can say something perfect.”\n <br /><br />\nThe Cults story is really one of chance meetings, chances so fortuitous you may wonder if something stronger – something more like fate – was at work. How else to explain the fact that Madeline happened to be in San Diego, Brian’s hometown, and the two happened to be in attendance at the same concert with a mutual friend. How else to explain the fact that, for some unknown reason, Madeline had left half her belongings in San Francisco, prompting Brian to offer to drive the round trip to collect them, during which the pair would cement their relationship by bonding over each other’s iPod collection (from Lesley Gore and Jay-Z to Justin Timberlake). And how else to explain the fact that Madeline and Brian both happened to be embarking on a imminent move to New York to study film, ensuring that they spend endless hours of time together and Brian got the chance to hear Madeline singing over the first songs he'd ever written. \n <br /><br />\nThrilled but shy about their new recordings, the pair tentatively put them up on a Bandcamp page in February 2010 and gave the tracks to a few friends under the stipulation that they don’t share them. Fortunately their friends didn’t always obey orders and “Go Outside” found it’s way to music blog Gorilla Vs Bear who posted the unknown demo to a roaring reception. More fate, you might say. And here’s some more – Gorilla Vs Bear just so happened to be starting up a label, Forest Family Records, and were looking for an undiscovered new band to launch it with.\n<br /><br />\nIn April of 2010 Cults released a “Go Outside” 7” single with Forest Family that sold out before the copies even went to print. Over the next several months the band would release a few more tracks from these early recordings, record a track called “Oh My God” for Adult Swims single series, build on the true nature of their musical desires and evangelize new listeners nationwide.\n<br /><br />\nAfter a few standout performances last fall at the 2010 CMJ Festival in which music’s elite praised the duos’ simplistic pop charm, Cults decided their next move would be to put a full album out with a bigger label and signed to the newly-created Sony imprint ITNO. The band’s self-titled release is – like the original demos – self-produced, although engineer Shane Stoneback (Sleigh Bells, Vampire Weekend) was brought on board to tighten things up. A love of hip hop is also evident in their use of repetition: “We wanted the melody to be the thing that breaks the music out of its monotony,” says Brian. “In that sense some of our songs aren’t far off from early Wu Tang stuff where they’d sample soul records.”\n <br /><br />\nThat all this happened for Cults in the space of a year says a lot about the band's sense of spontaneity. And the fact that most people didn't know the first thing about them when they heard their music? That just worked to their advantage – especially as a sense of mystery and intrigue has been absent from rock’n’roll for too long.\n <br /><br />\n“Bands have become way too handy at promoting themselves,” says Brian. “There’s nothing left to ponder if there is too much information – you can just consume it and throw it away.”\n<br /><br />\nAnd as for why the band chose the name Cults: “A lot of our songs are about what we’re going through right now – the fear of growing up and facing adult responsibility,” says Brian. “And in a way that fear is what makes people join cults in the first place – wanting to escape competition and success and be a part of something bigger, communal. We also want to live our own lives with our own schedules and expectations, so in a way this band has become our own cult.”","musicbrainz_id":null}},"category":"Music","end_time":"Fri, 05 Aug 2011 17:30:00 -0500","google_date":"20110805T214500Z/20110805T223000Z","title":"Cults","updated_at":"2011-06-15 12:53:45 -0500","conference_category":null,"time":"04:45 PM","date":"Friday 08/05/11","id":"462263","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/event/2011/08/05/cults","photo_thumb_small":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14912/sq_44.jpg","start_time":"Fri, 05 Aug 2011 16:45:00 -0500"},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14916/sq_90.JPG","votes":"3201","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/events/462262.json","bands":{"band":{"display_date":"2011-08-05","photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14916/sq_90.JPG","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14916/original.JPG","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/120771.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"51","location":"Lineup - Main","tier":"5"}},"main_lineup_position":"75","facebook_url":"http://www.facebook.com/tinietempahofficial","twitter_username":"tinietempah","setlist":null,"title":"Tinie Tempah","updated_at":"2011-05-05 19:44:58 -0500","youtube_id":"cbaIN_K1FEg","similar_bands":{"similar_band":[{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/17848.json","title":"KiD CuDi"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/14587.json","title":"Atmosphere"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/43316.json","title":"Jay Electronica"}]},"flickr_tag":"tinietempah","id":"120771","echonest_id":"ARHTUZB11F50C4C14C","homepage":"http://www.tinietempah.com/us/","myspace_link":"http://www.myspace.com/tinietempah","fan_count":"3392","description":"For decades, US music charts have seen what they call a “British Invasion” take place. From\nThe Beatles and Rolling Stones to Wham!, Culture Club and Tears For Fears, this\nphenomenon does not seem to skip any generation. In the latest decade, we have seen\nColdplay, Amy Winehouse., and more recently, artists like Taio Cruz and Jay Sean hit the top\nof the charts. It is with this in mind that the undisputed British breakout star of 2010, Tinie\nTempah, has set his sights on America.\n<br /><br />\nTinie Tempah has had an incredible year ‐ few debut artists boast three hit singles, a\nGlastonbury performance on the Pyramid stage and millions of YouTube views. He is\nofficially certified as the best selling British debut act of 2010. Yet this 22 year‐old artist has\ncaptivated music fans, celebrities and critics alike in just a matter of months.\nTinie began the year as a newly signed artist in the melee of other musicians hoping to make\nan impact on the UK music scene. His major label debut single Pass Out hit No.1, and has\nsince had in excess of 11 million views. Its follow‐up, Frisky, shot straight to No.2 and has\nbeen viewed over 8 million times. Combined, both singles have sold upwards of 750,000\ncopies. His third single, Written In The Stars, reached #1 and thus far, he has sold over one\nmillion singles in the UK alone. His debut album, DiscOvery,\ndebuted at #1 in the UK, and\nwent gold in its first week, further proving his star power. Tinie plans to duplicate this\nsuccess streak in the US by introducing himself with his number one UK banger Pass Out\nfollowed by the melodic, and also number one UK single, Written In The Stars.\nWritten In The Stars, produced by Swedish powerhouse Ishi, details the 21 year‐old’s past,\npresent and future ambitions. “I’m trying to live the dream and other people can do the\nsame if they put their mind to it. That’s what the song is about. You can do everything I’ve\ndone, if you’re determined and driven enough.” Featuring the incredible vocals of Boston\nnewcomer Eric Turner, the epic, synth‐led single features crisp drums, razor‐sharp guitars\nand a considered message delivered in Tinie’s uniquely credible style. “I used to be the kid\nthat noone\ncared about, that’s why you have to keep screaming till they hear you out,” raps\nTinie.\n<br /><br />\nWhile the first singles sound like bonafide radio smashes, they are just a taste of what’s to\ncome on Tinie’s debut album, Disc‐Overy, set for release in May 2011. As well as\nhighlighting the finer things in life that success can offer, Tinie details the lows of fame and\nfortune, as well as offering a candid insight into his childhood growing up in south London.\n“On every single song you’ll get a line that reveals what life was, and is, like for me. I\nrecorded a lot of it after Pass Out went to No.1, so that gave me a chance to reflect on life\nbefore and after achieving success. When I’m in the studio, it’s just me in my tracksuit, a\nbottle of water and my thoughts. Going to No.1 gave me a chance to consider how far I’ve\ncome, but also how far I intend to go.”\n<br /><br />\nAn incredibly confident debut, DiscOvery\ncertifies Tinie's absolute ability to achieve\nworldwide success. With Tinie already on the US radar thanks to remixes with Diddy and\nSnoop, DiscOvery\nreasserts his global appeal by offering inventive production and a range\nof rhymes that are in turn frank and funny. The diverse and imaginative album features\ncollaborations with Ellie Goulding and Kelly Rowland and production from Labrinth\n(Pass Out, Frisky), newcomer Ishi, Al Shux (Jay‐Z’s Empire State Of Mind) and Naughty Boy\n(Chipmunk, Wiley), as well as renowned dance producers Swedish House Mafia.\n<br /><br />\nThe song Simply Unstoppable underscores Tinie’s roots while Swedish House Mafia have\ncreated an undeniable dancefloor anthem in the form of Miami 2 Ibiza, and Naughty Boy\ndelivers a deliciously brooding pop number Let Go, featuring Emile Sande. One of Tinie’s\npersonal favourites, the laidback Snap talks about chronicling life photographically,\nincluding “My mom and dad’s wedding picture, which is my favourite photo in the world”,\nwhile Wonderman features Ellie Goulding and is produced by Labrinth. “I wanted this\nalbum to be really raw, not only in terms of the production but the guests. I was only\ninterested in working with people I really respect and who I’m a fan of. I met Ellie very early\non, we swapped numbers and after that we started living very parallel worlds; the same\nfestivals, interviews and so on. It made total sense to have her on the album.”\n<br /><br />\nHe may be distinctive in his delivery and creative in his approach to the business of music,\nyet the charismatic rapper’s own background is much like an average kid anywhere in the\nworld. “I’ve never tried to be anything than what I am. I was well bought up, I liked school, I\nliked learning, I’m well educated, I’m well spoken,” Tinie reflects. His mom and dad were\nkeen to keep their kids away from trouble, moving the family from Peckham to Plumstead\nwhen Tinie was 11. It's thanks to his capital city upbringing that Tinie has been able to\nachieve all he has. \"London is one of the only places in the world where you can live in a\ncouncil block and see a beautiful semi‐detached house across the street. Growing up around\nthat was inspirational, it kept me motivated.\" Yet, despite success on the underground, few\nwould have predicted just how hugely successful he would become.\n<br /><br />\nSince signing, he has accomplished more than anyone might have imagined ‐ yet for this\ndriven young man, it’s clearly just the beginning of an already incredible career. With a\nlong‐term goal in mind, Tinie is far from a one‐hit wonder. This pragmatic, prudent MC is\nmindful of the decisions he makes, and has big plans for himself.\n<br /><br />\n“I really want people to get this album, I want them to listen to it as a whole and see that not\nall the tracks are chart‐driven. I really wanted to give people some ‘Tinie Time’ for an hour,”\nhe insists. “I want people to see this is not a joke to me; now I’m here and I’ve been given the\nopportunity, I’m not messing around. I’m looking to take my tour, the videos, the music,\neverything, completely beyond what you can fathom. It’s never just another day in the life of\nTinie; I’ve got a lot to do and you can bet on the fact that I’ll do it.”","hometown":"London, UK","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/tinie-tempah","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"For decades, US music charts have seen what they call a “British Invasion” take place.

Entertainment Weekly praised it as a ”sing-along for hipsters who remember how to party unironically” and The Onion’s AV Club called it “mature, compelling, and totally unexpected.” MTV’s Newsroom went as far as calling it the “best album of the year (so far).”\n<br /><br />\nNothing but blue ahead.","musicbrainz_id":null}},"category":"Music","end_time":"Fri, 05 Aug 2011 20:15:00 -0500","google_date":"20110806T001500Z/20110806T011500Z","title":"Ok Go","updated_at":"2011-06-15 13:12:23 -0500","conference_category":null,"time":"07:15 PM","date":"Friday 08/05/11","id":"462265","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/event/2011/08/05/ok-go","photo_thumb_small":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14888/sq_44.jpg","start_time":"Fri, 05 Aug 2011 19:15:00 -0500"},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14882/sq_90.jpg","votes":"8739","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/events/462266.json","bands":{"band":{"display_date":"2011-08-05","photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14882/sq_90.jpg","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14882/original.jpg","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/35247.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"19","location":"Lineup - Main","tier":"4"}},"main_lineup_position":"28","facebook_url":"http://www.facebook.com/RATATAT","twitter_username":null,"setlist":null,"title":"Ratatat","updated_at":"2011-05-27 15:36:17 -0500","youtube_id":"97KfDhJdOKI","similar_bands":{"similar_band":[{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/21336.json","title":"The Glitch Mob"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/32495.json","title":"Girl Talk"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/44130.json","title":"Pretty Lights"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/92561.json","title":"The Bloody Beetroots Death Crew 77"}]},"flickr_tag":"ratatat","id":"35247","echonest_id":"AREPZK61187B990670","homepage":"http://www.ratatatmusic.com/","myspace_link":null,"fan_count":"9384","description":"Ratatat (Mike Stroud and Evan Mast) are pleased to announce the release of LP4 through XL Recordings on June 8, 2010.

If you’re lucky, they might be a true friend; someone you spend\nmore time talking with than you do with your family, maybe even your partner. Imagine if the two of you had the chance\nto leave your jobs behind and go on a crazy, incredibly fun, sometimes stressful but ultimately mind-blowing two-and-ahalf-\nyear musical adventure across continents and time zones, racking up accolades from the likes of Rolling Stone,\nSpin, People and Pitchfork.\n<br /><br />\nTo the Australian indie-rock duo of Kate Cooper (singer/guitarist) and Damon Cox (drummer/singer), An Horse — who\nwent from rehearsing after hours in a Brisbane record store to playing “Camp Out,” the single from their 2009 debut,\nRearrange Beds, on Late Show With David Letterman — making their second album, Walls, isn’t just a chance to set\nthe agenda for their next phase. It’s also an opportunity to reflect on the fantastical journey that has carried them here, a\npipe dream made thrillingly real.\n<br /><br />\n“We'd worked in the record store together for a couple of years and talked every day — even on days off — mostly\nabout music and film, which we continue to do every day now.” says Damon. “After listening to music all day together at\nwork for two years, we had a really clear idea of what we liked and disliked musically.” That bond was the backbone of\nRearrange Beds; after two years of relentless touring, though, including stints out on the road with Tegan & Sara, Death\nCab For Cutie, Cage the Elephant, Silversun Pickups and The Big Pink, An Horse had become a different animal\naltogether.\n<br /><br />\nCooper, like Cox, is frank in her assessment of their earlier album. “With Rearrange Beds, we made a record of two\npeople learning how to play together. I don't think you can hear that on the album per se, but that's what it was.” This\ntime, the pair decided to make a record that reflected their bond not just as music aficionados, but as musical\ncollaborators. “Walls was really deliberate,” Kate explains. “We had hundreds of shows under our belt and we had\nfigured out how to play off each other.”\n<br /><br />\nRegrouping in Vancouver after recharging their batteries in their respective homes — Cooper in Montreal, Cox in\nMelbourne — An Horse brought in Howard Redekopp (who has lent his sonic wizardry to The New Pornographers and\nTegan and Sara as well as An Horse — Redekopp mixed Rearrange Beds) to produce the album. Now the duo would\nfigure out how to play off the studio, too.\n<br /><br />\n“We had many lengthy discussions with Howard before we arrived in Vancouver to record,” says Damon, “and did five\ndays of pre-production — pulling the songs apart, putting them back together, throwing some songs away and even\ncreating new ones — which is something we'd never had the luxury of doing.”\n<br /><br />\nThe atmosphere was comfortable and creative, which was just what they needed. “During the recording, Howard\nbrought his old dog Fanny into the studio,” Kate explains with a wry chuckle. “One day I was getting up in Fanny's face\nwhile Damon was recording with a video camera. I was talking to her, telling her she was such a lovely dog, but Howard\nquickly intervened when he found us. He told us that Fanny had personal space issues and, had I gotten any closer,\nFanny would have had my nose! A few weeks earlier, Fanny had bitten our assistant engineer Jaret's face and he had\nto be rushed to the hospital with Fanny sitting beside him in the car.”\n<br /><br />\nWalls has plenty of the whip-smart, energetic rock that propelled An Horse half-way across the world. The album’s\nopening track, “Dressed Sharply,” is as fizzy and explosive as a shook-up bottle of champagne, spraying the listener\nwith showers of melody and noise. It’s no surprise that the tune is a fan favorite already, thanks to having been\npreviewed in their recent shows. But on the song that follows it, “Not Mine,” the craft and care that went into Walls’\nmaking becomes even clearer. Kate and Damon’s passionate vocals, weave into a pattern with Kate’s chiming guitar,\nbuilding the intensity slowly and deliberately as Damon’s drums nudge the momentum along.\n<br /><br />\nIt’s a powerful tension, one that marks the separation between Rearrange Beds and Walls, where the duo frequently\nreturn to that place where anything can shrink into a whisper or explode into a howl. “They’re my favorite songs on the\nrecord; songs like ‘100 Whales,’ where the mood fits in the middle. We wanted to make a record that sounded way\nbigger and more powerful, but not so big and crazy that it didn't sound like two people,” Damon says.\n<br /><br />\nThe result is a towering sound that doesn’t buckle when it gets quiet, or for that matter, serious. Walls’ songs span a\nwide spectrum of emotions, which came to the surface after Kate had moved to Montreal. “I was really stoked because I\nhad met a girl and was having a good time, but there were also a lot of really terrible things that had happened.”\nMore specifically, the lyrics deal with the wrenching angst of being stuck on tour while a family member falls ill. Plenty of\nsongwriters have observed the monotony of endless hours logged on the interstate, but when your mom phones you to\ntell you that she has to have major surgery and you can’t run to her side all the way in Australia, suddenly you’ve got\nbigger problems than the lack of roadside scenery between Buffalo and Pittsburgh.\n<br /><br />\n“No one in my family told me about my mom’s condition because they didn’t want me to come home,” Kate explains.\n“They said, ‘we didn’t want to worry you.’ So eventually I had this conversation with my mum where she said, ‘Alright,\nwell, I’m gonna go in now and get this done,’ and I was, like, ‘Alright, bye…’ it was crazy. I was struck with this sense\nthat I would have to spend as much time with everyone I care about now because they could die, but I’m going to be on\ntour, so I can’t.”\n<br /><br />\nThere’s a disarming intimacy in Kate’s lyrics, whether she’s relating the experience of waiting for her mom’s results in\n“Brain on a Table,” or the less dramatic but vividly observed “Windows in the City,” where she describes games people\nmake up on the phone when things like geography or work come between them. Both a sense of playfulness and\nfeelings of longing are never far from the surface.\n<br /><br />\nKate: “I think most of the songs for Walls were written in December 2009 to January 2010, when I was in Montreal. I\nwas discovering a new city but I was missing everyone back home. And I was definitely getting frustrated with feeling\nlost.\n<br /><br />\n“When it’s minus 30 degrees out and my girlfriend’s working and my friends are away, and it’s like, what do I do in this\napartment? I just wrote songs. Which was cool, I was really productive.\n<br /><br />\n”In the apartment, there was a bird that wouldn’t shut up. His name was Uncle Pete and his painful ‘cheep cheep’ is all\nover the demos. I had to send them to Damon with notes like ‘at 2:23, TURN DOWN’ because Uncle Pete's chirps were\nso loud,” Kate recalls.\n<br /><br />\nWhen all was said and done, the album had become every bit as rich and varied as the time in their lives that it capped\nthe end of.\n<br /><br />\n“It was a really rewarding and emotional process making Walls,” Damon says. “We could kind of reflect on what a crazy\ntwo and a half years we'd had. When we finished up I felt like I could breathe again, like a massive weight had been\nlifted. The warm Vancouver summer felt like an old friend guiding us though it all. It was a really exciting time.” — Dave\nMorris","hometown":"Australia","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/an-horse","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"Anyone who’s ever punched a clock has a work buddy.

I just wrote songs. Which was cool, I was really productive.\n<br /><br />\n”In the apartment, there was a bird that wouldn’t shut up. His name was Uncle Pete and his painful ‘cheep cheep’ is all\nover the demos. I had to send them to Damon with notes like ‘at 2:23, TURN DOWN’ because Uncle Pete's chirps were\nso loud,” Kate recalls.\n<br /><br />\nWhen all was said and done, the album had become every bit as rich and varied as the time in their lives that it capped\nthe end of.\n<br /><br />\n“It was a really rewarding and emotional process making Walls,” Damon says. “We could kind of reflect on what a crazy\ntwo and a half years we'd had. When we finished up I felt like I could breathe again, like a massive weight had been\nlifted. The warm Vancouver summer felt like an old friend guiding us though it all. It was a really exciting time.” — Dave\nMorris","musicbrainz_id":null}},"category":"Music","end_time":"Sat, 06 Aug 2011 13:45:00 -0500","google_date":"20110806T180000Z/20110806T184500Z","title":"An Horse","updated_at":"2011-06-15 12:27:43 -0500","conference_category":null,"time":"01:00 PM","date":"Saturday 08/06/11","id":"462303","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/event/2011/08/06/an-horse","photo_thumb_small":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14949/sq_44.JPG","start_time":"Sat, 06 Aug 2011 13:00:00 -0500"},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14946/sq_90.jpg","votes":"2639","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/events/462304.json","bands":{"band":{"display_date":"2011-08-06","photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14946/sq_90.jpg","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14946/original.jpg","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/36680.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"66","location":"Lineup - Main","tier":"5"}},"main_lineup_position":"89","facebook_url":"http://www.facebook.com/mapsandatlases","twitter_username":"mapsnatlases","setlist":null,"title":"Maps & Atlases","updated_at":"2011-06-13 10:47:20 -0500","youtube_id":"KSlA7x98Yfw","similar_bands":{"similar_band":[{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/12684.json","title":"Portugal.

They did it from scratch and pulled these amazing, timeless melodies out of thin air.\" It's a combination that may not seem logical, but when you hear it you'll know you need it, you've gotta have it and it's what you've always been looking for.” ","musicbrainz_id":null}},"category":"Music","end_time":"Sat, 06 Aug 2011 17:30:00 -0500","google_date":"20110806T214500Z/20110806T223000Z","title":"The Drums","updated_at":"2011-06-15 13:07:36 -0500","conference_category":null,"time":"04:45 PM","date":"Saturday 08/06/11","id":"462307","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/event/2011/08/06/the-drums","photo_thumb_small":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14907/sq_44.jpg","start_time":"Sat, 06 Aug 2011 16:45:00 -0500"},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/1074740/9a1ed47d48617ba74b1707eb8d10b684_sq_90.jpeg","votes":"4284","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/events/462308.json","bands":{"band":{"display_date":null,"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/1074740/9a1ed47d48617ba74b1707eb8d10b684_sq_90.jpeg","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/1074740/9a1ed47d48617ba74b1707eb8d10b684_poster.jpeg","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/129180.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"32","location":"Lineup - Main","tier":"4"}},"main_lineup_position":"39","facebook_url":"http://www.facebook.com/elliegoulding","twitter_username":"elliegoulding","setlist":"0","title":"Ellie Goulding","updated_at":"2011-05-11 10:23:48 -0500","youtube_id":"0NKUpo_xKyQ","flickr_tag":"elliegoulding","id":"129180","echonest_id":"ARKTTJV12592CDA07F","homepage":"http://www.elliegoulding.com","myspace_link":"http://www.myspace.com/elliegoulding","fan_count":"4548","description":"Having already conquered her native Britain with the biggest and fastest selling debut album of 2010, Lights-- premiering at No. 1 on the U.K. album chart, four hit singles she co-wrote, and a BRIT award -- singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding is ready to make a similar splash in America with her sparkling electro-folk-pop sound. Lights is, as the New York Times put it, “a happy car crash of signifiers: part electro-pop, part soul, part blues, part indie rock, part folk” that mixes heartfelt emotion with other-worldly atmospherics. Anchoring her songs with acoustic guitar, Goulding and her producer, Starsmith, spin cool electronica into dreamy warmth on “Starry Eyed,” “Guns and Horses,” “The Writer,” and “Under the Sheets.”\n<br /><br />\n“I’m not afraid of pop or electronic music,” Goulding says of the euphoric, dance-till-you-drop vibe of Lights, “but I also wanted the album to embrace my love for folk music, not just by my playing guitar on it, but by writing about things that have truly affected me. I wear my heart on my sleeve and am aware of how I’m feeling all the time, so it’s impossible for me to write words that are contrived or meaningless.”\n<br /><br />\nGoulding’s lyrics are refreshingly direct as she chronicles the highs and lows of love in her airy, gossamer voice. “Under The Sheets” addresses sleeping around, while “Animal” revels in the feverish state of falling in love. “The Writer” cops to her being paralyzed with obsession over a lover. “I’ve gotten so many messages from girls who can relate to ‘The Writer,’” Goulding says. “I think anyone can get to the point where they love someone so much that they just start doing ridiculous things, like smoking or drinking, or dressing differently, I know I’ve done it.” “Guns and Horses” is about falling in love with someone who doesn’t really know how to love and wanting to take their pain away. The album takes its title from the song “Lights,” which is about Goulding’s fear of the dark. “Having a light on always makes me feel safe,” she says. “It gives me strength, which is why I named the album after that song.”\n<br /><br />\nThen there’s the first U.S. single “Starry Eyed,” which Goulding describes as “one of those rare songs that isn’t melancholy and is actually a bit happier. I kind of throw everything to the wind and say, ‘Who cares about emotions? Let’s just have fun,’” she says with a laugh. “I love sad songs, but I also appreciate feel-good songs.” \n<br /><br />\nA self-taught singer and guitarist, Ellie was raised with her three siblings in Hereford, a cathedral city about 16 miles east of the Welsh border. After her parents divorced when she was five, Goulding moved to the tiny rural village of Lyonshall with her mother and her mother’s new boyfriend, a lorry driver. “I basically went from living in the city to suddenly living in the countryside,” she says. “At first I hated it, but I slowly grew to love it and became completely fascinated by being surrounded by all this wide open space – it still colors everything I do to this day.”\n<br /><br />\nMoney was scarce, so Ellie shared a bedroom with her two sisters. “It wasn’t easy, plus there was the added stress of my dad leaving, but I got along okay,” she says. Her first memory of becoming interested in music is wanting to sing the loudest in her school’s assemblies. “I was pretty quiet, but I really loved to sing and would use my voice at any opportunity,” she says. “We couldn’t afford lessons, so I learned by copying other singers, like Lauryn Hill, Beyonce, and Celine Dion; I loved singers whose voices were really powerful.” Being a performer, however, didn’t seem like a real possibility. “It didn’t feel like something that could ever really happen, coming from my background,” she says. At 15, obsessed with bands like Deftones, Pearl Jam, and Rage Against the Machine, Goulding taught herself to play guitar. “The minute I could master actually strumming and singing at the same time was when I started writing proper songs,” she says. In her teens, Goulding sang one of her own compositions for a family friend, who encouraged her to listen to folk music. She soon became inspired by such artists as Alison Krauss, Fleet Foxes, Joni Mitchell, and Sufjan Stevens.\n<br /><br />\nIt was while studying Politics, English, and Drama at the University Kent in Canterbury, where Goulding first found the confidence to perform onstage after winning a university talent competition. Gigs in London followed and soon Goulding was looking for a producer to help her flesh out her songwriting ideas. She discovered Vincent Frank, a British electro-pop musician and producer who goes by the name Frankmusik, and got in touch with him via MySpace. “He listened to my demos and really loved them, so we started working together and writing more songs,” she says. “I began getting more gigs and that’s when I realized I wanted to drop out of university to focus on music.”\n<br /><br />\nGoulding moved to London and locked herself in her room with a guitar. Songs like “The Writer,” “Starry Eyed,” “Salt Skin,” “This Love,” and “Your Biggest Mistake,” came pouring out. After a friend sent a link to a MySpace page for Fin Dow-Smith, a remixer, composer, and musician who works under the moniker Starsmith, Goulding sent him a demo she’d done, which resulted in a fruitful working relationship that continues to this day. \n<br /><br />\n“Fin understood that it was pop, but a bit more emotional,” Goulding says of Starsmith, who’s known for his remixes of tracks by Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, and Passion Pit, among others. “I liked that he was this really cool DJ with really fresh sounds, but wasn’t afraid of pop music. Working with him was when I started to have faith in my writing and thinking something could actually come of giving music a go.”\n<br /><br />\nThe two began making tracks an album in the summer of 2009, demos of which caught the attention of the major labels in the U.K. Goulding signed with Polydor Records and released her first single “Under the Sheets,” which she later performed, along with “Guns and Horses,” on Later…With Jools Holland, a star-making appearance that won her the attention of both critics and fans. In early 2010, it was announced the Goulding had topped the “BBC Sound of 2010” poll, which surveys critics and broadcasters for their top choices for rising stars in the coming year. She also won the Critics’ Choice Award at the 2010 BRIT Awards (previously won by Adele and Florence & the Machine). In February, “Starry Eyed” was released as a single (climbing to No. 4 on the U.K. Singles chart), followed by the March release of Lights, which shot straight to the top of the U.K. Albums chart. \n<br /><br />\n“I found out that the album was No. 1 while driving through the countryside on my way home from a gig up north,” she says. “I was very emotional and, quietly, very proud. I felt like this was just the beginning.” And it was. More hit singles followed, “The Writer” and a cover of Elton John’s “Your Song,” which climbed to No. 2 after being featured in a Christmas commercial for British retailer John Lewis. Goulding hit the road and sold out three headlining tours in the U.K., and performed at numerous music festivals, including Glastonbury, V Festival, and T in the Park, earning rave reviews for her joyful, no-holds barred live shows. \n<br /><br />\nNominated for two 2011 BRIT Awards (for “British Female Solo Artist” and “British Breakthrough Act”), Goulding is gearing up for the Stateside release of Lights. “I’m really excited to come to America and visit new places and see new countryside,” she says. “I feel ready to introduce my music and see what people think of it there. I’m hoping they’ll like it and be inspired, the way I was when I first heard certain artists. I want to create that excitement you get when you’ve discovered something special and feel happy to have ever come across it in the first place.”","hometown":null,"link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/ellie-goulding","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"Having already conquered her native Britain with the biggest and fastest selling debut album of 2010, Lights-- premiering at No. 1 on the U.K. album chart, four hit singles she co-wrote, and a BRIT award -- singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding is ready to make a similar splash in America with her sparkling electro-folk-pop sound.

Her mother giving birth to her standing up and without anaesthesia was a manifestation of the revolutionary hospital’s credo  –  “Being born on a woman’s terms” and possibly the first confrontation with womankind to found Lykke Li’s struggle with the concept of belonging. \n<br /><br />\nThe Zachrissons were the family that wouldn’t sit still, moving from Sweden to New Zealand, to Portugal where they settled in a mountain village to escape radiation in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster. A compliant rebel child whose first steps were taken barefoot on sharp pebbles to the sound of peacocks and thunder, spending her winters in India, Nepal and Morocco, her school years in 11 different establishments, Lykke soon turned to scribbling poetry and dancing, not out of interest but out of necessity. When the family moved back to Sweden several years later, the now nine year old was already a wanderer by nature, restless and ancient at heart.\n<br /><br />\nAt 19, dancing was no longer enough of an outlet for Lykke Li’s increasingly loud soul, singing what she felt became the beginning of a cure for the ailments of youth and the confinement of Stockholm suburbs. So she took her business to New York, toughed things out in Bushwick, hustled and bustled, uptown and down. Waking up in her rat infested closet of a flat the morning after getting booed off stage at an open mic night with the hard knock conviction that “This is as rough as it gets. It’s all downhill from here”, \nshe knew that artistry in what ever form would always be her life. \n<br /><br />\nBadabing Badaboom.\n<br /><br />\nBack in Stockholm, broke and alone but ready to rumble, Lykke copped the ears of producer Björn Yttling (from Peter, Bjorn & John) and found in him a Henry Higgins to her Billy The Kid as he became the one to initiate her into the world of recording and writing songs for an honest living.\n<br /><br />\nIn 2007 the pair recorded the 14 songs that would become Lykke Li’s acclaimed debut album Youth Novels, a release that quickly gained notoriety, setting the 21 year old up for a breathtaking race around a world of claustrophobic backstage rooms, bright lights, indecent parties, busy airports, rotten people, beautiful strangers, wrinkled couture and stripper shoes, goodwill rags and butterfly knives in overworked suitcases. And heartbreak...\n<br /><br />\nGod bless heartbreak, and so say all of us, because out of it came the haunting song Possibility, taken from a severely beat up belief in love, written for the Twilight - New Moon movie and embraced by millions of young vampire hearts longing for the right not to belong. And love.\n<br /><br />\n”My last tango with love ended really badly, but you could say I broke my own heart. Love was just my tool and the heartache my ghost. Something to grab onto when everything else falls apart...”.\n<br /><br />\nAfter two manic years of practically every place, person and pleasure on the face of the earth calling for her attention - except for love - Lykke Li found herself in desperate need for a place to lay her head rather than another stage to fill. With no actual place to call home, she decided to take on New York once again, to live a little!\n<br /><br />\n“I spent two months there, just having a good time. But I was drained,\nNew York was the wrong place for me to be at the time. Too many bloodsuckers, it got the best of me. And once I pulled the plug, once I was quiet and alone and the flood of offers and invitations started to run dry, I had to think about who I was. And although my circumstances had changed so dramatically, although I had every opportunity I ever wanted, I still felt the same as before. The same existential anxiety, the same restlessness. I hadn’t changed with the world around me, I was holding on. I had to do something, I had to grow.’ \n<br /><br />\nAnd so Lykke Li fled west, into the California desert, starred in a trippy, dark Moses Berkson film called Solarium and buried part of her bruised heart \nin the scalding sand. The rest of it came with her to a house on a hill in east \nLos Angeles where she bought a bicycle and an autoharp, rented a not so grand piano, put some flowers ‘round her room, and sat down to think.\n<br /><br />\nSettled in, a little bit lonely and faced with the Gainsbourgeois fear that \nthe ghost of a love that never really lived will never cease to haunt you, will always stay inside you, unborn and undead, she turned to records for solace.\n<br /><br />\nThe Echo Park hilltop soon trembled with music stemming from minds of that same contemplative, refined, painful place. Leonard Cohen, Neil Young and Dr John mixed with the Velvet Underground and This Mortal Coil, all under the omnipresent hex of Alan Lomax’s field recordings, Whisky and Darjeeling.\n<br /><br />\nBut like anyone in the midst of longing and loss, Lykke Li was eager to recover and rediscover the essence of the music in her self. She found herself thirs-ting for the raw power of simplicity, for some form of straight up truth. \nShe came to the conclusion that regardless of any fear, any loss and any longing, it’s not about the pearl in the oyster but about the grain of sand that forms it. About the coal itself, not the diamond it could become. About the now that will inevitably turn into then, and the when that may never turn into now. \n<br /><br />\nAnd she began to write.\n<br /><br />\n“I wanted back to the beginning, to where songs meant something. I wanted minimalism, just lyrics and melodies. Like all great songs, I wanted mine to really stand the test of being played with nothing but handclaps and vocals.”\n<br /><br />\nChanneling the demise of The Shangri La’s leader of the pack, women under the influence, ladies and gentlemen of the canyon, a Kung-fu Marianne Faithful and an armed Nancy Sinatra on peyote, she made music. Out of her head came voodoo drums, a few aching chords, churning and unholy, staggering and lolloping, and a voice that had suddenly turned from yearning to demanding, from fragile to undressed.\n<br /><br />\n“When I sing… it’s always about my most private emotions, I wouldn’t talk to anyone about them. But it’s my stage, my space, where I can express as much as I want. Either way, I set the boundaries, I make the rules. You can’t come in.”\n<br /><br />\n‘These scars of mine make wounded rhymes tonight’, she sings, putting her sophomore album’s title into context. A second born album demanding the right not to belong, convinced that it does all the same, from a performer of equal parts life and afterlife, love and destruction, fight and faith.\n<br /><br />\n“This could be it, you know. Really. My last Hurrah. I needed this album to be the real thing, I had to make it last people for decades. Just in case.”\n<br /><br />\nIn the words of a mother who once stood up giving birth to an artist: \n<br /><br />\n“Dance while you can”, Lykke Li sings.<br />\n“Dance ‘cause you must”.","hometown":null,"link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/lykke-li","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"Lykke Li Zachrisson was born in 1986, the middle child to a photographer mother and a musician father.

Something to grab onto when everything else falls apart...”.\n<br /><br />\nAfter two manic years of practically every place, person and pleasure on the face of the earth calling for her attention - except for love - Lykke Li found herself in desperate need for a place to lay her head rather than another stage to fill. With no actual place to call home, she decided to take on New York once again, to live a little!\n<br /><br />\n“I spent two months there, just having a good time. But I was drained,\nNew York was the wrong place for me to be at the time. Too many bloodsuckers, it got the best of me. And once I pulled the plug, once I was quiet and alone and the flood of offers and invitations started to run dry, I had to think about who I was. And although my circumstances had changed so dramatically, although I had every opportunity I ever wanted, I still felt the same as before. The same existential anxiety, the same restlessness. I hadn’t changed with the world around me, I was holding on. I had to do something, I had to grow.’ \n<br /><br />\nAnd so Lykke Li fled west, into the California desert, starred in a trippy, dark Moses Berkson film called Solarium and buried part of her bruised heart \nin the scalding sand. The rest of it came with her to a house on a hill in east \nLos Angeles where she bought a bicycle and an autoharp, rented a not so grand piano, put some flowers ‘round her room, and sat down to think.\n<br /><br />\nSettled in, a little bit lonely and faced with the Gainsbourgeois fear that \nthe ghost of a love that never really lived will never cease to haunt you, will always stay inside you, unborn and undead, she turned to records for solace.\n<br /><br />\nThe Echo Park hilltop soon trembled with music stemming from minds of that same contemplative, refined, painful place. Leonard Cohen, Neil Young and Dr John mixed with the Velvet Underground and This Mortal Coil, all under the omnipresent hex of Alan Lomax’s field recordings, Whisky and Darjeeling.\n<br /><br />\nBut like anyone in the midst of longing and loss, Lykke Li was eager to recover and rediscover the essence of the music in her self. She found herself thirs-ting for the raw power of simplicity, for some form of straight up truth. \nShe came to the conclusion that regardless of any fear, any loss and any longing, it’s not about the pearl in the oyster but about the grain of sand that forms it. About the coal itself, not the diamond it could become. About the now that will inevitably turn into then, and the when that may never turn into now. \n<br /><br />\nAnd she began to write.\n<br /><br />\n“I wanted back to the beginning, to where songs meant something. I wanted minimalism, just lyrics and melodies. Like all great songs, I wanted mine to really stand the test of being played with nothing but handclaps and vocals.”\n<br /><br />\nChanneling the demise of The Shangri La’s leader of the pack, women under the influence, ladies and gentlemen of the canyon, a Kung-fu Marianne Faithful and an armed Nancy Sinatra on peyote, she made music. Out of her head came voodoo drums, a few aching chords, churning and unholy, staggering and lolloping, and a voice that had suddenly turned from yearning to demanding, from fragile to undressed.\n<br /><br />\n“When I sing… it’s always about my most private emotions, I wouldn’t talk to anyone about them. But it’s my stage, my space, where I can express as much as I want. Either way, I set the boundaries, I make the rules. You can’t come in.”\n<br /><br />\n‘These scars of mine make wounded rhymes tonight’, she sings, putting her sophomore album’s title into context. A second born album demanding the right not to belong, convinced that it does all the same, from a performer of equal parts life and afterlife, love and destruction, fight and faith.\n<br /><br />\n“This could be it, you know. Really. My last Hurrah. I needed this album to be the real thing, I had to make it last people for decades. Just in case.”\n<br /><br />\nIn the words of a mother who once stood up giving birth to an artist: \n<br /><br />\n“Dance while you can”, Lykke Li sings.<br />\n“Dance ‘cause you must”.","musicbrainz_id":null}},"category":"Music","end_time":"Sat, 06 Aug 2011 20:15:00 -0500","google_date":"20110807T001500Z/20110807T011500Z","title":"Lykke Li","updated_at":"2011-06-15 13:11:23 -0500","conference_category":null,"time":"07:15 PM","date":"Saturday 08/06/11","id":"462309","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/event/2011/08/06/lykke-li","photo_thumb_small":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/1190478/bd6e45f2163c9b01742b5e16fadd6021_sq_44.jpeg","start_time":"Sat, 06 Aug 2011 19:15:00 -0500"},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14879/sq_90.JPG","votes":"5208","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/events/462310.json","bands":{"band":{"display_date":"2011-08-06","photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14879/sq_90.JPG","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14879/original.JPG","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/34773.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"16","location":"Lineup - Main","tier":"4"}},"main_lineup_position":"25","facebook_url":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Beirut/177902655585308","twitter_username":null,"setlist":null,"title":"Beirut","updated_at":"2011-05-05 19:44:55 -0500","youtube_id":"N-mqhkuOF7s","similar_bands":{"similar_band":[{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/34653.json","title":"The Mountain Goats"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/37852.json","title":"Bright Eyes"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/172958.json","title":"Ryan Bingham & The Dead Horses"}]},"flickr_tag":"beirut","id":"34773","echonest_id":"ARQOBT71187FB4CCCA","homepage":"http://www.beirutband.com","myspace_link":null,"fan_count":"5556","description":"In a typical teenager’s New Mexico bedroom, Zach Condon recorded Gulag Orkestar shortly after quitting college, with some help from local musicians Jeremy Barnes and Heather Trost (A Hawk and a Hacksaw).

Because right now, Fences is just coming into its own, with the release of a stunning debut album, entitled, naturally, Fences.\n <br /><br />\nThe ten-song set was co-produced by Sara Quin of Tegan & Sara, who Mansfield credits not only with helping him sculpt the most fully realized expression of his music to date, but also giving him impetus to forge ahead before they'd ever collaborated artistically. \"I was just working as a breakfast cook, spending my money at the bar, and playing songs with my friends in my kitchen. It was no big deal. And then when she contacted me, I remember thinking, Whoa! My life might be a little different from now on.\" Not to exaggerate the impact of her interest—this isn't The Blind Side, folks—but encouragement from an established recording artist went a long way towards making Mansfield take his music more seriously.\n <br /><br />\n\"Everything that Chris writes, melodically and lyrically, has that rare balance of patience and urgency that I love in honest, haunting pop songs,\" says Quin. And she did her homework before arriving at that laudatory conclusion. Prior to recording Fences, Quin requested that Mansfield send her everything he'd written to date.

He speaks with audible affection of '80s innovators like the Cure, Kate Bush, and Morrissey, icons who created a consummate, all-encompassing aesthetic, just as he aspires to do with Fences. A close listen to the rhythm tracks on several cuts also underscores Mansfield's love of down-tempo classic country. An anthology of Johnny Cash's Sun Records sides was one of his constant soundtracks while working as a dishwasher. \"The tempo of that material just has a unrelenting drive,\" he reflects. \"It carries the lyrics from start to finish before you even realize what has been said.\"\n <br /><br />\nFurther enriching his sound, Mansfield also has a powerful affinity for jazz, citing John Coltrane, Miles Davis, and Wayne Shorter among his favorites. \"Sometimes that music is just so chaotic, which is what growing up feels like,\" he observes. \"I always wondered why more confused teenagers didn't listen to jazz. The girl you're in love with doesn't love you back? Go home and put on Charlie Parker playing 'Embraceable You.'\" Later he studied at the Berklee College of Music in Boston.

The cover of his self-released 2008 Ultimate Puke EP may have seemed better suited to a sludge or speed metal band, with it's well-executed cartoon of a grizzly bear regurgitating a half-digested Fences logo, but Mansfield commissioned that imagery for specific reasons: \"That EP was a mix of all these demos and shit on my computer,\" literally purged from his hard drive. Plus he wanted a sleeve that eschewed the obvious visual vocabulary a comparable artist might've chosen. \"You wouldn't expect that kind of art to accompany this sort of music, you'd expect maybe a cute little bird on the cover.\"\n <br /><br />\nOn the other hand, for the more thoughtful Fences, he chose a personal talisman, a found photograph (of a young girl covered in Christmas tinsel) he'd long used as a bookmark. \"I wanted this album to look slightly mature and beautiful, but you still can't categorize exactly what that might be.

And Fences is just the first taste of great things to come.","musicbrainz_id":null}},"category":"Music","end_time":"Sun, 07 Aug 2011 13:45:00 -0500","google_date":"20110807T180000Z/20110807T184500Z","title":"Fences","updated_at":"2011-06-15 12:56:56 -0500","conference_category":null,"time":"01:00 PM","date":"Sunday 08/07/11","id":"462347","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/event/2011/08/07/fences","photo_thumb_small":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14947/sq_44.JPG","start_time":"Sun, 07 Aug 2011 13:00:00 -0500"},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14980/sq_90.jpg","votes":"1542","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/events/462348.json","bands":{"band":{"display_date":"2011-08-07","photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14980/sq_90.jpg","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14980/original.jpg","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/83866.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"64","location":"Lineup - Main","tier":"5"}},"main_lineup_position":"87","facebook_url":"http://www.facebook.com/daleearnhardtjrjr","twitter_username":"dalejrjrmusic","setlist":null,"title":"DALE EARNHARDT JR.

Inspired by her Grandfather, a former international barbershop quartet champion, she would sing along at her Lutheran church but she was never a choirgirl.

In the spring of 2006, she started a weekly residency with musician friends at Crane’s Hollywood Tavern in her neighborhood, which she named ‘Beachwood Rockers’ Society’.  Lissie made ends meet handing out restaurant flyers and selling honey every Sunday at the local farmer’s market. “Raw honey,” she recalls. “I would say, ‘Have you tried the world’s best-tasting honey? It’s not heated, treated, whipped or spun!’”\n<br><br>\nLittle by little, things came together.  She recorded a five-track EP, Why You Runnin’, with her friend Bill Reynolds (of Band of Horses) and in London with Ed Harcourt, which Fat Possum released in November 2009. The EP caught the attention of new fans and the U.S. press, with praise rolling in from Paste, Nylon, Filter, and Marie Claire, among others. She toured with Ray LaMontagne, A.A.

Eventually she extricated herself from a long, troubled relationship and relocated to Ojai, CA, population just shy of 8,000.  She rented an old farmhouse she had never seen, in a town she had never visited, “just because I sat next to someone from there on an airplane who told me it was nice.” She likes it up there. “It’s fairly slow, everything closes early and you can see all the stars at night. There are mountains outside my front door and it’s really quiet, which means I get a lot of work done and have time to myself, which is essential for me to function. I can still drive into LA for some excitement when I want, going out and being around other people is equally important to me.”\n<br><br>\n“All these things,” she says, talking a little about her new hometown in CA, and a little about her music, too, “I do them without thinking. So much of my process is instinct and it’s natural. Even in photo shoots I won’t wear concealer, I don’t want to look like someone painted my face.  Everything I do I want to feel natural; I want it to mean something to me.  If it doesn’t feel natural I can’t do it. I can’t act. I’m not good at faking it.”\n<br><br>\nAnd this is the essence of Lissie, something straight-down-the-line, unaffected. “Now I’ve gotten older I really found myself recognizing the hometown Midwesterner in me and embracing it,” she says. “For better or worse it may not be all that tactful or that cool, but there’s no phoniness. It’s pretty direct. And I’m direct; I’m not hiding anything.

The answer is Best Coast, the latest musical endeavor by perennially cool, self-described “weird girl” Bethany Cosentino. Best Coast was born when Cosentino decided to come home to LA after a time in New York City, to get a fresh start at living in the place she knows best—California. Quickly garnering praise from critics and listeners with the single “Sun Was High (So Was I),” Cosentino was approached by UK-based label Blackest Rainbow, who released her now sold-out tape Where the Boys Are. Also in the works are two new 7-inch’s, one being released by San Diego-based Art Fag Recordings and the other, the debut release from brand-new Brooklyn label Group Tightener.\n<br /><br />\nA Los Angeles native, Cosentino grew tired of what she had grown up with and did what so many have done before—she picked up and left for the East Coast, specifically Brooklyn, with the intention of going to art school for Creative Writing. “I was like, I hate the beach, I hate flip flops. I want to go to New York.” But Brooklyn quickly turned out to be far different from what she had envisioned. “I realized that I actually liked all those things, they reminded me of home,” and life in New York was too cold, both literally and figuratively, with too many people trying way too hard, “it’s like, there are people in New York who look like they’re at the beach sometimes but it’s not real, it’s not the same.”\n<br /><br />\nLooking for a way to get a taste of her native land all the way in Brooklyn, Cosentino was drawn to the ‘50’s and ‘60’s aesthetic of The Beach Boys and The Everly Brothers, which, she says, “made me happy.” Creating her own little Southern California in her bedroom wasn’t enough, however, and one weekend Cosentino decided enough was enough. “One weekend I just decided to leave New York. Two days later I was back in LA,” Cosentino says matter-of-factly. She started making music almost immediately, having been “inspired by the music I was listening to in New York,” Cosentino “wanted to be making the music I wanted to listen to.” Because of this, the project’s aesthetic is intended and natural, a combination of Cosentino’s influences and her inherent Californian-ness.\n<br /><br />\nAlthough Best Coast began in her bedroom, with Cosentino recording demo’s all on her own, she soon realized that she could use a little bit of help getting the vibe exactly right. For this she enlisted Bobb Bruno, a staple of the LA music scene who has previously recoded bands like Mika Miko and Abe Vigoda, played with the likes of Nels Cline, and opened for PJ Harvey and Wilco.

The answer is Best Coast, the latest musical endeavor by perennially cool, self-described “weird girl” Bethany Cosentino. Best Coast was born when Cosentino decided to come home to LA after a time in New York City, to get a fresh start at living in the place she knows best—California. Quickly garnering praise from critics and listeners with the single “Sun Was High (So Was I),” Cosentino was approached by UK-based label Blackest Rainbow, who released her now sold-out tape Where the Boys Are. Also in the works are two new 7-inch’s, one being released by San Diego-based Art Fag Recordings and the other, the debut release from brand-new Brooklyn label Group Tightener.\n<br /><br />\nA Los Angeles native, Cosentino grew tired of what she had grown up with and did what so many have done before—she picked up and left for the East Coast, specifically Brooklyn, with the intention of going to art school for Creative Writing. “I was like, I hate the beach, I hate flip flops. I want to go to New York.” But Brooklyn quickly turned out to be far different from what she had envisioned. “I realized that I actually liked all those things, they reminded me of home,” and life in New York was too cold, both literally and figuratively, with too many people trying way too hard, “it’s like, there are people in New York who look like they’re at the beach sometimes but it’s not real, it’s not the same.”\n<br /><br />\nLooking for a way to get a taste of her native land all the way in Brooklyn, Cosentino was drawn to the ‘50’s and ‘60’s aesthetic of The Beach Boys and The Everly Brothers, which, she says, “made me happy.” Creating her own little Southern California in her bedroom wasn’t enough, however, and one weekend Cosentino decided enough was enough. “One weekend I just decided to leave New York. Two days later I was back in LA,” Cosentino says matter-of-factly. She started making music almost immediately, having been “inspired by the music I was listening to in New York,” Cosentino “wanted to be making the music I wanted to listen to.” Because of this, the project’s aesthetic is intended and natural, a combination of Cosentino’s influences and her inherent Californian-ness.\n<br /><br />\nAlthough Best Coast began in her bedroom, with Cosentino recording demo’s all on her own, she soon realized that she could use a little bit of help getting the vibe exactly right. For this she enlisted Bobb Bruno, a staple of the LA music scene who has previously recoded bands like Mika Miko and Abe Vigoda, played with the likes of Nels Cline, and opened for PJ Harvey and Wilco. Cosentino and Bruno have been friends since Cosentino was a teenager, and she knew right away that he was someone she could trust with her project; “Bobb’s from California, he grew up here, he understands,” Cosentino says, adding that “he really, totally just gets it.”\n<br /><br />\nBest Coast sounds the way music sounds when it comes over the beach from the parking lot, where the cutest boy in school is getting out of his car.

But for the first time, I’m not blaming anyone but myself,” Hull says. Produced fat, tactile and beautiful by Dan Hannon, Simple Math is Hannon’s third full-length LP with the band, starting with the debut album I’m Like A Virgin Losing A Child and then the follow-up Mean Everything To Nothing.  Recorded at Blackbird Studios in Nashville and mixed by Joe Chiccarelli, the band kept the same studio set-up and production team intact from their second to third records.\n<br /><br />\nSimple Math is a concept album.  As Roy Shuker defines in his book Popular Music: The Key Concepts, a concept album is a record \"unified by a theme, which can be instrumental, compositional, narrative, or lyrical.\"  Simple Math is indeed unified by all of these. The instrumentation is big, even in its smallest moments.  The composition is emotional and complex, expertly weaving music with story.  The narrative is a trip through a man’s brain, through his mistakes, regrets and realizations.  And the lyrics, which take us firsthand through this life-changing experience, are poetic and raw, honest and passionate.  \n<br /><br />\nBut Manchester Orchestra has always been about truth; about passion.  It’s why Alternative Press gave MO’s 2009 acclaimed Mean Everything to Nothing (which yielded the Top 10 Modern Rock hit “I’ve Got Friends”) a five-star lead review that called the album “a masterpiece of intricacy and honesty.”  You can feel their passion in the power of Hull’s voice and the fury of the band’s music in every track they’ve ever laid down, a power that wraps itself around you and demands your attention as Hull’s lyrics guide you through the world as he sees it. “I’ve always had a clear perception of right and wrong around me,” says Hull, “I’ve constantly questioned my beliefs, trying to find the truth.”  \n<br /><br />\nThe son and grandson of southern ministers, Hull formed Manchester Orchestra in 2004 at the age of 17 with his lifelong friends (Jonathan Corley on bass, keyboardist Chris Freeman, guitarist Robert McDowell and drummer Tim Very) and used their music as a way to explore the issues that mattered most to him, issues of life, emotional vulnerability and the human condition. “I’ve always believed in God, but modernized Christianity can scare me.  I’m a spiritual, but not a religious, person. And I like to use my music to explore how that faith stretches and challenges me to be a better man.”\n<br /><br />\nIn 2005, before they were even old enough to vote, Manchester Orchestra headed out on the road and played over 200 shows, quickly building a legion of loyal fans that grows bigger and bigger with every show they play and every album they release. “We wouldn’t showcase for the record labels,” says Hull of the band’s early days.  “We wanted to play as many gigs as we could and we wanted the labels to come see us live, with our audience, in the clubs.”  And the labels came. In 2007, their explosive first record I’m Like a Virgin Losing A Child became a critical favorite, the New York Times praising it as “Music to swoon to.” Two years later, Mean Everything to Nothing arrived and was heralded as one of the best records of 2009, with Absolute Punk raving: “Quick note to the rest of the albums coming out this year: The bar has just been set.” And now with the arrival of Simple Math, the bar has been set yet again. “The songs on this record are stories,” explains Hull, “but more directed and personal. In many ways, it can be called a dueling conversation between my wife, God and myself.”\n<br /><br />\nThe opening track “Deer” sets a simmering and descriptive starting-point to Hull’s and our journey.  It begins with an honest confession, carefully full of vivid detail.  The lyric I’d go out in public if nobody ever asked perfectly sums up just how hard it is to lead a normal life once your pain becomes public. This is followed by the hard driving and rich Mighty, which Hull describes as sounding “like the Apocalypse.  It’s my darkest hour, in a sense.” The third track, Pensacola, is a meditation on where the band has taken him and where he thinks he may be heading.  “In this song, the innocence is leaving,” says Hull. The raw and masterful April Fool is next, an exquisite dynamite blast of big guitars, giant drums and soaring harmonies that, ironically, “was my first attempt at a love song on this album.” This moves directly into Pale Black Eye, a power-chord powder keg that builds from controlled discourse (“The song is sung three ways: Me to God, me to my wife, and God to me”) to earthshaking confession, a rock and roll bloodletting.  Bite your veins/ bleed your pain/ into me.\n<br /><br />\nVirgin appears next, a four and a half minute rock opera that looks back at the road that led the band to the present. “It’s a tri-fold story that parallels three ‘firsts’ for me,” explains Hull.  “The loss of my virginity, the potential loss of relationship, and the realization that our band has and will change after our first album. To all of these issues, the same lyric applies: It’s never gonna be the same.” It’s here that the heartfelt and elegant title track (and first single) Simple Math arrives.  “This is a song about an affair, non-existent but unrealized. I cannot hide from the truth. It finds me.  The chorus is myself questioning God.  Had I convinced myself, my family, my band that something is real when it isn’t?” Leave It Alone next slips quietly (at first) into the aftermath, a beautiful yet angry recounting of a three-hour argument brought on by what five years on the road can do to someone.  “I love the last line, If we end up alone, a plague on my head and a curse on our home.  This song is my realization that there’s a chance no one will ever love me like my wife Amy.”\n<br /><br />\nSecond from last is Apprehension, a sobering, lyrical tour through the guilt, the blame, the questioning of who’s at fault. “Not only is the song about Amy and me, it’s also about several friends and family members going through a miscarriage.  It represents that even after all has been mended in one heavy situation, life will continue to give you trials that require immense trust and faith in someone or something.” And ending it all is Leaky Brakes, which tiptoes quietly but confidently in to lead us back into the present.  “The final breath is essentially to admit to everything I’ve ever done wrong,” says Hull of this final track.  “The lyrics are so evolved compared to where we began.  It’s all here and ready to be confronted.  It’s up to me now.”\n<br /><br />\nRarely does an album come along of such monumental honesty and vulnerability. The power of the music, the complexity of the songwriting, the opportunity to hear a band at the top of their game evolving before our very eyes – it all makes Simple Math so much more than a collection of songs, so much more than just a concept album.  Simple Math is a deeply emotional experience.  And, simply put, it is a masterwork.","hometown":null,"link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/manchester-orchestra","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"On April 1st, 2009, Andy Hull started to put his life back together.\n<br /><br />\nManchester Orchestra’s new album, Simple Math, is about that experience. “It’s the reaction to my marital, physical, and mental failures.
