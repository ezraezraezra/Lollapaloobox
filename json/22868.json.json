Eleven songs, eleven tones of excitement recorded “quickly and painlessly” in just under a month in London late last year at the hands of producer Dan Grech.\n<br /><br />\nIt’s a record that favours ‘the song’ over all other disciplines. It’s best articulated in one of the record’s shortest (and most dizzy) tunes, If You Wanna.\n<br /><br />\n“That song was the turning point,” explains Justin Young, lead singer of The Vaccines. “It crystallized what we were and where we were going. What followed was a process of shaving the songs down to their very essence”.\n<br /><br />\nIf You Wanna cuts through with a sharp simplicity, so much so that the demo version the band put online in the summer of 2010 was rapidly noticed.  It was a starting point for the band - Freddie Cowan (guitar), Arni Arnason (bass) and Pete Robertson (drums) who, alongside Justin finally kick-started The Vaccines in the spring of 2010 after a fair few months of rehearsals honing their sound.\n<br /><br />\n“We never set out with any sort of mission statement, but when we first started playing we quickly realised that through our shared love of the ‘perfect pop song’ there was a real bond, we all felt really invigorated and excited by the music we were making,” says Justin. “If there was ever any quest, it was to create direct pop music with depth and emotion, the sort of stuff that The Modern Lovers, The Velvet Underground and The Clash made sound so easy.”\n<br /><br />\n“A lot of the arrangements were much more complicated when the songs were conceived,” adds Justin. “But we got to a point where we were confident to just strip everything away. Being that direct seemed to carry so much more emotion.”\n<br /><br />\nAs Justin says: “some of The Vaccines songs sound simple, but making them sound like that is one of the most difficult things of all to do.”\n<br /><br />\nConsider the minute and half squeal of Nørgaard or debut single ‘\nWreckin Bar (Ra Ra Ra), songs that perfectly showcase the kick-and-rush-riffarama of The Vaccines’ default setting. They’re much like modern lullabies, songs that wiggle their way into your consciousness and won’t let go. \n<br /><br />\nOr the stuttering Wolf Pack or the bubblegum romance of Under Your Thumb; confident, headstrong songs that are testament to the young songwriter’s almost veteran status having written his first song aged eleven (“about girls and stuff, things I didn’t really understand”) and spent his teenage years in a variety of bands.\n<br /><br />\nYet The Vaccines debut isn’t just Ramones punch and Jesus and Mary Chain swagger. Blow It Up is all woozy eyed atmospherics, evocative on record as it was at its first London outing last October, at the bands Flowerpot show in London. Then there’s Wetsuit, more modern hymn than pop song, Freddie’s guitar coaxing rich colour out of the skeletal verse and big, brave choruses. “I’m always been more into sound than songs,” says the guitarist, younger brother of The Horrors’ Tom. “That’s what I bring to the band - texture”.\n<br /><br />\n“My favourite song on the record is Family Friend” says Arni of the record’s closing opus (in that at five, it’s a rare venture over the three minute mark). “I think it wraps the record up nicely, Justin’s lyrics are beautiful, but it ends the record on a question mark. Sort of like, this is what we do… but this is what we might do next.”\n<br /><br />\n“I want people to love the record like we do,” says Justin of this band’s debut, “but I want them to be as excited as I am about where The Vaccines go next too.

That was a huge moment for me. This is what real bands do: play to an international audience, millions of people, with one of the most famous men in the world. Being part of that was incredible. We were like little kids, running about the studio, sitting in his chair. Probably the most ‘big-time’ thing we got to do.”\n<br /><br />\nCharles Cave, bass player, got his moment of thrilling validation by the side of a Polish motorway. “We’d never played Poland before, and our bus broke down four hours from a festival we were booked at. We sat there for ten hours. They sent cars out to get us. And we were thinking, we’ve got a 9pm slot in a tent in a country we’ve never played before. Is this all worth it? What are we stressing out for? But we got there, got changed, and walked on stage to probably the most insane crowd we’ve ever had. There must have been 20,000 people crammed into this tent. And when the first song started, it was obvious everyone knew every single word.”\n<br /><br />\n“I felt a bit sick to be honest,” admits the band’s loquacious, thoughtful lyricist. “I’ve never felt quite so emotionally battered by a gig. And now Poland is one of our best places to go. And that show represents the hard work that we put in outside of the UK. A lot of bands that I suppose are our rivals, or our contemporaries, are doing a lot better than us statistically in the UK. But we have a fanbase around the world, places like Poland, Russia, Japan, Mexico…”\n<br /><br />\n“The two nights at Brixton Academy were very special,” says Harry McVeigh, singer with the three-piece who formed in west London in 2006. “Kind of homecoming shows, but it just felt amazing to be in a venue we’d all grown up going to. And to bring in a huge production – we felt like a professional band,” he adds. “Suddenly it was this ‘huge’ thing.”\n<br /><br />\nA huge thing indeed. To Lose My Life entered the UK charts at number one when released in January 2009 and went on to sell well over 750,000 copies around the world. New band of the year gongs at both the Q and Mojo awards alongside NME cover features and a coveted number 2 slot in the NME readers album of the year poll confirmed that 2009 had been some year for White Lies.\n<br /><br />\nAnd so to late 2010. Recharged, excited and buoyed by a new-found self-belief, White Lies have taken the experiences they gleaned traveling the world and alchemised them into Ritual, their full-blooded, big-booted tech-rock second album.\n<br /><br />\nThe trio’s confidence, gung-ho vigour and ambition are on display in the moody, classically-framed electronica of Peace And Quiet, Lawrence-Brown’s favourite track. “It means a lot to me. It was the last one we did in the studio, so there was quite a lot of closure involved. But, for me, it’s the high point of the record. It felt different recording it - freer, much looser. It has the most organic feel, even though it has electronic drums at the start and end.”\n<br /><br />\nAnd then there’s the band’s choice of Alan Moulder as producer. Alongside Max Dingel, who worked on To Lose My Life, the legendary man behind classic records by everyone from Them Crooked Vultures back to My Bloody Valentine, helped the band shape their ideas in his Assault And Battery studios in northwest London. “Alan’s the man we needed,” says Cave. “He’s older, wiser, a technical genius, and without a doubt he helped us realise everything we wanted to do but didn’t quite know how to get there.”\n<br /><br />\nAnd those qualities are the foundation of Ritual – a record that was written in five quick-smart weeks and recorded in six. No messing around, no faffing or flailing in search of a “new direction” or “sure-hit singles”. Just a band of teenage friends, evolving into a tight, focused, imaginative, mutually supportive three-way unit.\n<br /><br />\n“Initially we did have grand plans – we visited this really nice studio in Paris,” recalls Cave. “But this was three weeks into the writing process, and things were really going well. Two weeks later we were done. The vast difference in the writing this time was that Harry and I wrote it on his computer at home. Whereas last time we wrote it on a keyboard then translated it instantly into a three-piece set-up, recorded that, then added some more bits afterwards.”\n<br /><br />\nBut not that many bits – many elements of the demos for the songs on Ritual have survived. That’s how emboldened White Lies were. A development, they admit, that comes in part from the fact that their record collections have expanded “twenty-fold” since they made their first album.\n<br /><br />\n“Touring we’d built a huge bank of influences, songs and artists that we really liked,” says McVeigh. “For the first time in our lives we had a bit of money and the first thing we did was spent it on a load of music. That had a big impact – we were soaking all this new music up.\n<br /><br />\nTheir new listening habits – Richie Hawtin, in his Plastikman guise and other nommes de bleep; Swedish metal band Opeth; Danish producer Trentemøller – directly informed the techno throb of The Power & The Glory. “The glitchy sounding electronic percussion in that song is a direct homage to those things,” says Cave.\n<br /><br />\nThe first single is the towering, glowering, thumping Bigger Than Us.\n<br /><br />\n“It has quite a big chorus,” grins McVeigh. “It’s a good song for radio. I know it sounds like we think about which songs will do well, but I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. We’re a very ambitious band. We want the best for our record.”\n<br /><br />\nThe closing Come Down is another pivotal song. McVeigh’s voice, rich and resonant, floats over a minimal electronic beat-scape, both icy and warm, before… going somewhere else entirely.\n<br /><br />\n“We started off wanting that to be like a stripped down Tears For Fears,” smiles Cave. “Within ten minutes that idea had gone. The middle section which is full-on gospel and very R&B – well, we sat listening to it, smiling to each other, but going: I dunno, is this cool, is this any good? But we’re really proud of that moment. We like the fact that some people are gonna go, what the fuck is this?”\n<br /><br />\nThe album title, the lyricist adds, derives from the fact that “a lot of the songs deal with various rituals: daily rites of passage, things that all humans do which aren’t necessarily good for them. So a song like Holy Ghost is very literal, making observations on really extreme examples of fundamental religion. Whereas Strangers looks at the ritual of having a very unemotional, physical relationship with someone.\n<br /><br />\n“And in a way the album links all these different things and draws them all to the same conclusion. Is doing this really just a way of killing time or trying to find some purpose in life? And is someone who gets up every morning and prays for three hours any different in the way that they view their life compared to someone who sleeps with a different person or drinks themselves silly every night?”\n<br /><br />\nAdds McVeigh, “I like the title because it means everything but nothing all at the same time. It can refer to religion or love as the most important things in your life. Or it can refer to how every night you get back from work and watch TV, and that’s your ritual.”\n<br /><br />\nAnd for their next highlights… Live, last time round, White Lies expanded to a four-piece. This time they will be five. “More space, more power, more back-up,” nods Jack Brown.\n<br /><br />\n“I think we’ve just changed the intent. With the first record, while we might have denied it at the time, we were very much trying to be bombastic,” says Charles Cave with the brilliant, fierce honesty that informs everything White Lies do. “Quite overly dramatic. We were desperate to have a full string section! We wanted to be as big sounding as possible. I know that’s a loose, dangerous word that’s always thrown about by bands. But we did want that – and we possibly went a little too far.”\n<br /><br />\n“And we received a bit of criticism for sounding a little sterile at some points, or un-genuine. But we’ve fixed that – for one, the lyrics on the first album concerned fictional stories, albeit influenced by real people and events. That always makes it quite hard to get emotionally involved. But this time we’ve been much more ambitious, but in a quite unconventional way. We wanted to see how many cracks we could leave in the final thing. There are less than perfect performances in there.

Which for me is absolutely perfect.”\n<br /><br />\nPower, glory, peace, quiet, sex, religion, mistakes, passion, cracks, heart, soul – Ritual offers all these. And sometimes more. And sometimes less.","hometown":"London, UK","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/white-lies","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"Ask White Lies for their personal highlights of the 18-month world tour they undertook in support of 2009’s To Lose My LIfe and the answers come suitably fast, impassioned and diverse.\n<br /><br />\nFor drummer Jack Lawrence-Brown, he was reminded of his special memory a couple of months ago. “I found a t-shirt that we all got given when we went on the David Letterman show in New York. That was a huge moment for me. This is what real bands do: play to an international audience, millions of people, with one of the most famous men in the world. Being part of that was incredible. We were like little kids, running about the studio, sitting in his chair. Probably the most ‘big-time’ thing we got to do.”\n<br /><br />\nCharles Cave, bass player, got his moment of thrilling validation by the side of a Polish motorway. “We’d never played Poland before, and our bus broke down four hours from a festival we were booked at. We sat there for ten hours. They sent cars out to get us. And we were thinking, we’ve got a 9pm slot in a tent in a country we’ve never played before. Is this all worth it? What are we stressing out for? But we got there, got changed, and walked on stage to probably the most insane crowd we’ve ever had. There must have been 20,000 people crammed into this tent. And when the first song started, it was obvious everyone knew every single word.”\n<br /><br />\n“I felt a bit sick to be honest,” admits the band’s loquacious, thoughtful lyricist. “I’ve never felt quite so emotionally battered by a gig. And now Poland is one of our best places to go. And that show represents the hard work that we put in outside of the UK. A lot of bands that I suppose are our rivals, or our contemporaries, are doing a lot better than us statistically in the UK. But we have a fanbase around the world, places like Poland, Russia, Japan, Mexico…”\n<br /><br />\n“The two nights at Brixton Academy were very special,” says Harry McVeigh, singer with the three-piece who formed in west London in 2006. “Kind of homecoming shows, but it just felt amazing to be in a venue we’d all grown up going to. And to bring in a huge production – we felt like a professional band,” he adds. “Suddenly it was this ‘huge’ thing.”\n<br /><br />\nA huge thing indeed. To Lose My Life entered the UK charts at number one when released in January 2009 and went on to sell well over 750,000 copies around the world. New band of the year gongs at both the Q and Mojo awards alongside NME cover features and a coveted number 2 slot in the NME readers album of the year poll confirmed that 2009 had been some year for White Lies.\n<br /><br />\nAnd so to late 2010. Recharged, excited and buoyed by a new-found self-belief, White Lies have taken the experiences they gleaned traveling the world and alchemised them into Ritual, their full-blooded, big-booted tech-rock second album.\n<br /><br />\nThe trio’s confidence, gung-ho vigour and ambition are on display in the moody, classically-framed electronica of Peace And Quiet, Lawrence-Brown’s favourite track. “It means a lot to me. It was the last one we did in the studio, so there was quite a lot of closure involved. But, for me, it’s the high point of the record. It felt different recording it - freer, much looser. It has the most organic feel, even though it has electronic drums at the start and end.”\n<br /><br />\nAnd then there’s the band’s choice of Alan Moulder as producer. Alongside Max Dingel, who worked on To Lose My Life, the legendary man behind classic records by everyone from Them Crooked Vultures back to My Bloody Valentine, helped the band shape their ideas in his Assault And Battery studios in northwest London. “Alan’s the man we needed,” says Cave. “He’s older, wiser, a technical genius, and without a doubt he helped us realise everything we wanted to do but didn’t quite know how to get there.”\n<br /><br />\nAnd those qualities are the foundation of Ritual – a record that was written in five quick-smart weeks and recorded in six. No messing around, no faffing or flailing in search of a “new direction” or “sure-hit singles”. Just a band of teenage friends, evolving into a tight, focused, imaginative, mutually supportive three-way unit.\n<br /><br />\n“Initially we did have grand plans – we visited this really nice studio in Paris,” recalls Cave. “But this was three weeks into the writing process, and things were really going well. Two weeks later we were done. The vast difference in the writing this time was that Harry and I wrote it on his computer at home. Whereas last time we wrote it on a keyboard then translated it instantly into a three-piece set-up, recorded that, then added some more bits afterwards.”\n<br /><br />\nBut not that many bits – many elements of the demos for the songs on Ritual have survived. That’s how emboldened White Lies were. A development, they admit, that comes in part from the fact that their record collections have expanded “twenty-fold” since they made their first album.\n<br /><br />\n“Touring we’d built a huge bank of influences, songs and artists that we really liked,” says McVeigh. “For the first time in our lives we had a bit of money and the first thing we did was spent it on a load of music. That had a big impact – we were soaking all this new music up.\n<br /><br />\nTheir new listening habits – Richie Hawtin, in his Plastikman guise and other nommes de bleep; Swedish metal band Opeth; Danish producer Trentemøller – directly informed the techno throb of The Power & The Glory. “The glitchy sounding electronic percussion in that song is a direct homage to those things,” says Cave.\n<br /><br />\nThe first single is the towering, glowering, thumping Bigger Than Us.\n<br /><br />\n“It has quite a big chorus,” grins McVeigh. “It’s a good song for radio. I know it sounds like we think about which songs will do well, but I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. We’re a very ambitious band. We want the best for our record.”\n<br /><br />\nThe closing Come Down is another pivotal song. McVeigh’s voice, rich and resonant, floats over a minimal electronic beat-scape, both icy and warm, before… going somewhere else entirely.\n<br /><br />\n“We started off wanting that to be like a stripped down Tears For Fears,” smiles Cave. “Within ten minutes that idea had gone. The middle section which is full-on gospel and very R&B – well, we sat listening to it, smiling to each other, but going: I dunno, is this cool, is this any good? But we’re really proud of that moment. We like the fact that some people are gonna go, what the fuck is this?”\n<br /><br />\nThe album title, the lyricist adds, derives from the fact that “a lot of the songs deal with various rituals: daily rites of passage, things that all humans do which aren’t necessarily good for them. So a song like Holy Ghost is very literal, making observations on really extreme examples of fundamental religion. Whereas Strangers looks at the ritual of having a very unemotional, physical relationship with someone.\n<br /><br />\n“And in a way the album links all these different things and draws them all to the same conclusion. Is doing this really just a way of killing time or trying to find some purpose in life? And is someone who gets up every morning and prays for three hours any different in the way that they view their life compared to someone who sleeps with a different person or drinks themselves silly every night?”\n<br /><br />\nAdds McVeigh, “I like the title because it means everything but nothing all at the same time. It can refer to religion or love as the most important things in your life. Or it can refer to how every night you get back from work and watch TV, and that’s your ritual.”\n<br /><br />\nAnd for their next highlights… Live, last time round, White Lies expanded to a four-piece. This time they will be five. “More space, more power, more back-up,” nods Jack Brown.\n<br /><br />\n“I think we’ve just changed the intent. With the first record, while we might have denied it at the time, we were very much trying to be bombastic,” says Charles Cave with the brilliant, fierce honesty that informs everything White Lies do. “Quite overly dramatic. We were desperate to have a full string section! We wanted to be as big sounding as possible. I know that’s a loose, dangerous word that’s always thrown about by bands. But we did want that – and we possibly went a little too far.”\n<br /><br />\n“And we received a bit of criticism for sounding a little sterile at some points, or un-genuine. But we’ve fixed that – for one, the lyrics on the first album concerned fictional stories, albeit influenced by real people and events. That always makes it quite hard to get emotionally involved. But this time we’ve been much more ambitious, but in a quite unconventional way. We wanted to see how many cracks we could leave in the final thing. There are less than perfect performances in there. Harry’s voice has been worked like a horse over the last two years, and after 18 months of touring and smoking and drinking, it’s not the young, angelic, clear voice it was before. Which for me is absolutely perfect.”\n<br /><br />\nPower, glory, peace, quiet, sex, religion, mistakes, passion, cracks, heart, soul – Ritual offers all these. And sometimes more. And sometimes less.","musicbrainz_id":null}},"category":"Music","end_time":"Fri, 05 Aug 2011 17:00:00 -0500","google_date":"20110805T210000Z/20110805T220000Z","title":"White Lies","updated_at":"2011-06-15 13:08:20 -0500","conference_category":null,"time":"04:00 PM","date":"Friday 08/05/11","id":"462284","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/event/2011/08/05/white-lies","photo_thumb_small":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14891/sq_44.jpg","start_time":"Fri, 05 Aug 2011 16:00:00 -0500"},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14868/sq_90.JPG","votes":"6500","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/events/462285.json","bands":{"band":{"display_date":"2011-08-05","photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14868/sq_90.JPG","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14868/original.JPG","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/141602.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"7","location":"Lineup - Main","tier":"2"}},"main_lineup_position":"17","facebook_url":"http://www.facebook.com/aperfectcircle","twitter_username":"aperfectcircle","setlist":null,"title":"A Perfect Circle","updated_at":"2011-05-05 19:44:55 -0500","youtube_id":"s-GsLh6dazI","similar_bands":{"similar_band":[{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/42355.json","title":"Foo Fighters"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/34920.json","title":"Deftones"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/34200.json","title":"Explosions in the Sky"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/43866.json","title":"Rival Schools"}]},"flickr_tag":"aperfectcircle","id":"141602","echonest_id":"ARVDO8G1187B99F43E","homepage":"http://www.aperfectcircle.com/","myspace_link":null,"fan_count":"6914","description":"A Perfect Circle formed in 1999 with principal members Billy Howerdel (Ashes Divide) and Maynard James Keenan (Tool, Puscifer) creating a fluid band where line-ups were free to shift with each ensuing album.

The recipe for meteoric success? Six killer musicians, five dapper suits, irresistible songs, some serendipity and one vintage organ. \n<br /><br />\nSince their first show at Hollywood’s Hotel Café in December 2008, Fitz and co. have toured with Maroon 5, played to thousands at Colorado’s world famous Red Rocks Amphitheatre, shared the stage New Year’s Eve with Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings, and performed on KCRW’s esteemed show, Morning Becomes Eclectic. All this on the strength of their stellar five-song EP, Songs for a Breakup, Vol. 1.\n<br /><br />\nFor some bands, it takes a lifetime to build this success, but few performers deliver an unrestrained blast of soul-clapping, get-down-on-the-floor, moneymaker shakers like Fitz and the Tantrums. Now post-release of their debut full length, Pickin’ Up the Pieces, which has since earned them a 3 ½ star album review in ROLLING STONE, the troupe is poised to get down in dancehalls across the universe. \n<br /><br />\nIt all began when… [cue flashback sounds]\n<br /><br />\n“I got a call from my ex-girlfriend,” Fitz explains, “And she said, ‘My neighbor is moving out in a hurry and has to sell everything. And, he has this organ…”\n<br /><br />\nFitz, the Svengali frontman of the crew, describes the find like the discovery of a compass, or that treasure map in Goonies, which undoubtedly leads to adventure. Not one to say no, Fitz called some piano movers, cashed in some favors, and seven hours later, the organ went from the curb to his living room. That night, Fitz stationed himself in front of that vintage instrument and wrote a blue-eyed soul anthem, “Breaking the Chains of Love.”\n<br /><br />\n“Sometimes, the Music Gods just give it to you,” Fitz says.\n<br /><br />\nThe overflow of inspiration startled Fitz. He’d spent years in L.A.’s music industry, writing music and working in a studio with Beck producer, Mickey Petralia. But at those 88 keys, just seven hours after that organ dropped into his life, Fitz had finally found his voice. \n<br /><br />\n“I’ve always been a singer,” Fitz says, “but with so much music, I felt that I was trying to push a square peg through a round hole. I was being not true to myself, and it never felt right until I wrote that song, and I sang like that. I thought, this feels so real, so natural.”\n<br /><br />\nFitz shared his vision with long-time friend and saxophonist, James King, who immediately connected with the sound. While the electric guitar drives rock, the saxophone takes center stage in soul, and that’s the way Fitz likes it. “We wanted to find a new vocabulary for the genre, I wanted to make a record without any guitars. Could we make a huge sound with out any guitars?”\n<br /><br />\nA huge sound takes a huge studio--Motown had Studio A in Detroit, Philadelphia International had Sigma Studios, Phil Spector’s Wall of Sound was created in Hollywood’s legendary Gold Star Studios-- but when it came time to capture the feeling and the soul of soul, Fitz knew of the perfect studio: his home.  \n<br /><br />\nThere in the living room, he recorded Songs for a Breakup, Vol. 1, a burst of effervescent swingers and floor-stompers, infused with the energy of long forgotten songs. The infectious, rolling rhythms of “Breaking the Chains of Love,” immediately turns your head and actually get cemented in your brain, like a good pop song should.\n<br /><br />\nThe sound is familiar, but distinct. That’s what grabbed the attention of Maroon 5’s Adam Levine.  Levine was getting a tattoo in New York when the tattoo artist told him he had to hear this new band he had discovered. After that one encounter, Levine personally invited Fitz and the Tantrums to join their tour.  \n<br /><br />\nLike the EP, Fitz recorded the full-length debut back at home, to bottle the lightning that struck in those first jam sessions. He now delves into more acerbic lyrical territory, going on the offensive against gold diggers on the exceptionally funky “MoneyGrabber,” and even gets political on the piano-banging, handclap-driven call to action, “Dear Mr. President.” \"L.O.V.\" is a jaunt through pop music history embarking with a groovy organ intro, meandering through juicy big band breakdowns and Fitz's svelte croons, then carrying us away with flute outro. It's a funk-filled plea to give love a chance. These powerful songs take the band’s energy up a notch, but like their energized performances, they never loose control. \n<br /><br />\nThose blistering performances are now well-chronicled for adequate ubiquity, Last Call With Carson Daly nailing the money shot for “MoneyGrabber” at the band’s sold out show in November at LA’s El Rey Theatre featuring a sea of a thousand pogoing fans and a handful of F.A.T.T. gems rocked along with blue-eyed soul vet, Daryl Hall on the band’s spot on Live From Daryl’s House. Lest we forget, omnipresent the T-Mobile HTC ad that actually namechecks the band that, for the past several months, is impossible not to see if you’re watching even an hour’s worth of television. Oh, and there are the hot spots on Criminal Minds, Desperate Housewives and a great many more, not to mention a ton of success at radio for the aforementioned runaway “MoneyGrabber,” all with the promise of more to come. \n<br /><br />\nIn their sound and on the stage, Fitz and the Tantrums are nothing but professionals, and never less than classy. Enter the Tantrums, Fitz’s airtight ensemble keeping it real like it’s1969. Funky drummer John Wicks is a Motown B-side aficionado and prolific session player, Jeremy Ruzumna manned the keyboards for Macy Gray, while King and bassist Ethan Phillips backed De La Soul (Phillips has since been replaced by Joseph Karnes). Then there’s Noelle Scaggs, the powerful voice behind Fitz’s croons. Make no mistake, Scaggs is not just there for “doo-wops” and handclaps. She shimmies and flirts, she stokes the crowd and simmers them down, and she has no qualms about keeping Fitz in check. “She is not just a backup singer,” Fitz says, “We have repartee. Onstage, we’re Ike and Tina.”\n<br /><br />\nThere, on the stage, Fitz and the Tantrums are not just a band, they’re an explosion. Scaggs high steps it to the tight-as-hell rhythm section, while Fitz, cooler than cobalt, croons like the aforementioned Mr. Hall for a new generation. It’s obvious that this is no tryst for the band, this is a full-blown, head-over-heels love affair.

The first album has all the playful inventiveness of a group set free from musical constraints.”\n<br /><br />\nFollowing a sold out UK tour, seminal Coachella appearance and packed, emotional shows at the Roxy Theater in L.A. and Roseland Ballroom in NY,  B.A.D. look forward to coming back this summer to rock Lollapalooza.","musicbrainz_id":null}},"category":"Music","end_time":"Sat, 06 Aug 2011 17:30:00 -0500","google_date":"20110806T213000Z/20110806T223000Z","title":"Big Audio Dynamite","updated_at":"2011-06-15 12:36:57 -0500","conference_category":null,"time":"04:30 PM","date":"Saturday 08/06/11","id":"462328","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/event/2011/08/06/big-audio-dynamite","photo_thumb_small":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/15498/sq_44.jpg","start_time":"Sat, 06 Aug 2011 16:30:00 -0500"},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/15522/sq_90.jpg","votes":"11642","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/events/462329.json","bands":{"band":{"display_date":null,"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/15522/sq_90.jpg","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/15522/original.jpg","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/174776.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"8","location":"Lineup - Main","tier":"3"}},"main_lineup_position":"6","facebook_url":"http://www.facebook.com/ceelogreen","twitter_username":"ceelogreen","setlist":null,"title":"Cee Lo","updated_at":"2011-06-06 18:37:32 -0500","youtube_id":"pc0mxOXbWIU","flickr_tag":"ceelo","id":"174776","echonest_id":null,"homepage":"http://www.ceelogreen.com/","myspace_link":"http://www.myspace.com/ceelogreen","fan_count":"12552","description":"<div>Thomas DeCarlo Callaway (born May 30, 1974),[1] better known by his stage name Cee Lo Green, is an American singer-songwriter, rapper and record producer.

The band’s leader, Patrick Stickles – introduced the album at that time with a letter to the media. It is below, in its original glory. \n<br /><br />\nYou should know however, that since its release, it’s been heralded as one of 2010s top albums, and the critics fell immediately in love with it. \n<br /><br />\nDear distinguished members of the press, \n<br /><br />\nThe New Jersey indie rock band Titus Andronicus has recorded a new album, a follow-up to our 2008 (2009?) release, The Airing of Grievances. This new album, The Monitor, will see release thanks to our friends at XL Recordings on March 9th, 2010, the 148th anniversary of the Battle of Hampton Roads, wherein the U.S.S. Monitor and the C.S.S. Virginia entered into their epic struggle off the coast of Virginia. \nThe Monitor is more or less a “concept album” – that is to say, it uses the American Civil War of 1861-1865 as an extended metaphor for the concerns addressed in a somewhat linear narrative. In said narrative, our hero leaves his humble birthplace of New Jersey – the oppressive and stifling qualities of which were discussed ad nauseam about one album ago – for the greener pastures of Boston, Massachusetts. His thesis – “the enemy is everywhere” – is put to the ultimate test as he pontificates on the topics of regional identity, emotional anesthetization, and the heavy yoke of trying to live decently in indecent times. All the while, he is forced to wonder whether said American Civil War was truly won or lost, or even completed. Will he find the supportive environment and like-minded compatriots he dreams of? Or will he be forced to leave his newly adopted home in ideological disgrace? What does it mean to be an American in 2009 anyway? Who are our so-called “friends” and how actually friendly are they? Is it necessary, or even a good idea, for an indie rock album to ask these sorts of questions? The Dark Knight, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and The Taming of the Shrew also fit in there somewhere.\n<br /><br />\nThe Monitor was recorded during August of 2009, under the watchful eye of producer and engineer Kevin McMahon (who oversaw our first album, among others), at his studio – Marcata Recording – in New Paltz, NY. The usual suspects from the world of Titus Andronicus were all in attendance, as well as an all-star cast of luminous friends (members of Ponytail, Wye Oak, Vivian Girls, Hold Steady, etc.) and a generous assortment of colorful New Paltz locals. The aforementioned Kevin McMahon also did the mixing during September and October, and Greg Calbi did the mastering (so chosen because he is the only person alive who can claim involvement in both The Chemistry of Common Life by Fucked Up and Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell by Meat Loaf) in early November. \n<br /><br />\nSo what does all this sound like? It has long passages of ambient drones, blazing saxophone, pianos homages to “A Charlie Brown Christmas,” complete marching drumlines, Thunder Tube solos, fourteen-minute Billy Bragg knock-offs, backwards liturgical pieces, bombastic country duets, garbage cans hit with tambourines, choirs of angels with bromantic faces, probably too many spoken word interludes lifted from cassette tapes, and, of course, the hissy-fit punk songs and off-key warbling we have come to expect from Titus Andronicus. Did I mention that this record is sixty-five minutes long? Because that’s kind of important. Through and through, it is a wholehearted and potentially ill-advised grab for some sort of imaginary brass ring, the sound of a band desperate for success and defiantly unafraid of failure. That was the idea, at least. \n<br /><br />\nBlah blah blah Springsteen blah blah blah beer blah blah blah beard blah blah blah Shakespeare yadda yadda yadda Seinfeild blah blah blah Conor Oberst in a vat of acid blah blah blah books. \nThe Monitor will be available as a compact disc or as a double vinyl LP, both with gorgeous artwork by Nolen Strals, vocalist of Double Dagger and co-author of the recently published textbook, Lettering and Type, or in regular old MP3 format, featuring no gorgeous artwork at all. The tracklisting and cover can be found below, along with a video trailer created by official Titus Andronicus documentarian and the mastermind behind “Titus TV,” Alex Tretiak, MLS, which will hopefully stoke the fires of yr anticipation. \n<br /><br />\nIt is our dearest hope that you will find favor in our latest effort, and that the next year will find us the toast of the indie rock world. If not, well, that is okay, too, for we punks believe that the tree falling in the forest does make a noise, and of all those unheralded falling trees, we want to be the loudest. Hear us, or don’t, at yr discretion and/or own peril. \n<br /><br />\nYr friend,<br /> \nPatrick","hometown":"GLEN ROCK, NEW JERSEY","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/titus-andronicus","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"In March of this year, XL Recordings released Titus Andronicus’ epic second album THE MONITOR.

For Ryan\nBingham, who took home the Academy Award for “The Weary Kind,” his hauntingly\nbeautiful theme song for the acclaimed Crazy Heart, it instead represented a crossroads\nand a decision about which path to take.\n<br /><br />\n“When there are a lot of people around saying ‘look, you have to capitalize on this\nand do something really commercial,’ you might think about it for a second,” admits the\nLA-based singer-songwriter. “But at the end of the day, there’s not a chance in hell I\ncould do that. It made me sick to my stomach just thinking about it. I couldn’t get up in\nfront of people and play a bunch of stuff that didn’t mean anything to me.”\nBingham puts that philosophy to the test in a big way on Junky Star, his third\nalbum on Lost Highway, which was recorded in a matter of days with producer T Bone\nBurnett, his collaborator on the Crazy Heart soundtrack. The disc delivers a bracing\nfusion of pensive, gravelly ballads - like “Hallelujah,” which is not a Leonard Cohen\ncover, but his own take on mortality, delivered from the other side of the veil - and raw,\nrock‘n’roll cuts that showcase Bingham’s incisive, darkly compelling lyrical bent.\n<br /><br />\nBingham channels a number of unique spirits over the course of the album,\nleading with his sensitive side on “The Poet” and kicking out the jams on the Waylonmeets-\nKeith Richards “All Choked Up Again.” Elsewhere, as in songs like “Depression”\n- a vivid evocation of our current social climate that’d have Woody Guthrie nodding in\napproval - and the album’s poignant title track, Bingham applies his wizened rasp with\nprecise strokes, wringing emotion from every note.\n<br /><br />\n“I’ve always been passionate about the situation of homeless people and kids\nhaving to survive on the streets, so some of these songs come from that, from looking at\nwhat people need to do to survive,” he explains. “So Junky Star doesn’t have anything to\ndo with drugs or anything like that, it’s more about finding the beauty in what might at\nfirst appear to be rough around the edges. You can see that beauty in someone on the\nstreet, like some guy just raving and be like ‘I wonder what this guy has been through to\nget to that place?’”\n<br /><br />\nThe same might be said for Bingham himself. Born in New Mexico and raised all\nacross the Southwest, he set out on his own at a young age, shuffling from town to town\nlooking for a place to sleep between rodeos, day labor, and a weekly gig at a no-frills\nlocal bar.\n<br /><br />\nThat spirit infused Bingham’s Lost Highway debut, Mescalito, which won kudos\nfrom media outlets as varied as Rolling Stone, Esquire and The Washington Post - the\nlatter noted “anyone seeking to invent a modern-day Texas troubadour couldn’t do better\nthan to replicate Ryan Bingham’s life story.” Indeed, the disc opened many illuminating\nwindows into the soul of a man who, despite still being in his twenties, had already done\nplenty of living.\n<br /><br />\nThose experiences served Bingham well, earning him more critical acclaim for\n2008’s Roadhouse Sun, a disc that prompted Billboard to defer comparisons to forebears\nand note “Bingham's not a \"new\" anything: He's his own man, and a singular talent at\nthat.” That’s high praise indeed, but the opinion was shared by plenty of the singersongwriter’s\nmusical peers, including T Bone Burnett, who he collaborated with on the\nsoundtrack for Crazy Heart.","hometown":null,"link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/ryan-bingham-the-dead-horses","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"For some artists, winning an Oscar would represent reaching a pinnacle.

You can see that beauty in someone on the\nstreet, like some guy just raving and be like ‘I wonder what this guy has been through to\nget to that place?’”\n<br /><br />\nThe same might be said for Bingham himself. Born in New Mexico and raised all\nacross the Southwest, he set out on his own at a young age, shuffling from town to town\nlooking for a place to sleep between rodeos, day labor, and a weekly gig at a no-frills\nlocal bar.\n<br /><br />\nThat spirit infused Bingham’s Lost Highway debut, Mescalito, which won kudos\nfrom media outlets as varied as Rolling Stone, Esquire and The Washington Post - the\nlatter noted “anyone seeking to invent a modern-day Texas troubadour couldn’t do better\nthan to replicate Ryan Bingham’s life story.” Indeed, the disc opened many illuminating\nwindows into the soul of a man who, despite still being in his twenties, had already done\nplenty of living.\n<br /><br />\nThose experiences served Bingham well, earning him more critical acclaim for\n2008’s Roadhouse Sun, a disc that prompted Billboard to defer comparisons to forebears\nand note “Bingham's not a \"new\" anything: He's his own man, and a singular talent at\nthat.” That’s high praise indeed, but the opinion was shared by plenty of the singersongwriter’s\nmusical peers, including T Bone Burnett, who he collaborated with on the\nsoundtrack for Crazy Heart.","musicbrainz_id":null}},"category":"Music","end_time":"Sun, 07 Aug 2011 15:00:00 -0500","google_date":"20110807T191500Z/20110807T200000Z","title":"Ryan Bingham & The Dead Horses","updated_at":"2011-06-15 12:01:46 -0500","conference_category":null,"time":"02:15 PM","date":"Sunday 08/07/11","id":"462369","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/event/2011/08/07/ryan-bingham-the-dead-horses","photo_thumb_small":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14913/sq_44.JPG","start_time":"Sun, 07 Aug 2011 14:15:00 -0500"},{"photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14871/sq_90.JPG","votes":"6369","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/events/462370.json","bands":{"band":{"display_date":"2011-08-07","photo_thumb":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14871/sq_90.JPG","photo":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/band_alternate_photo/photos/14871/original.JPG","api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/133581.json","display_locations":{"display_location":{"position":"10","location":"Lineup - Main","tier":"3"}},"main_lineup_position":"19","facebook_url":"http://www.facebook.com/thecars","twitter_username":null,"setlist":null,"title":"The Cars","updated_at":"2011-05-05 19:44:57 -0500","youtube_id":"xxqxNzlEFM4","similar_bands":{"similar_band":[{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/146525.json","title":"Big Audio Dynamite"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/40813.json","title":"TAB the band"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/26512.json","title":"White Lies"},{"api_link":"http://api.dostuffmedia.com/bands/7292.json","title":"Cold War Kids"}]},"flickr_tag":"thecars","id":"133581","echonest_id":"ARLZLMN1187B9AD1CB","homepage":"http://www.thecars.org","myspace_link":null,"fan_count":"6735","description":"Move Like This, The Cars’ first album of new music in many years, is a vibrant and ingenious collection that expertly extends their already extraordinary canon.

Recorded at Sound City Studios in Los Angeles with long-time producer/ collaborator James Ford, it has a summery pop feel: with the bulk of work completed on the West Coast during January, it’s got the feel-good sound of stealing some winter sun, some out of season Vitamin D.\n<br /><br />\n‘Everyone was in a really good mood when we were there,’ says Alex Turner; ‘so I think the fact we were having a laugh comes across. When I’ve played it to friends they’ve said “it sounds like you’re having a really good time”, I think we wanted it to sound quite fun and up, not too serious’. \n<br /><br />\n‘It were more about making it more of a trip and an experience I suppose, going somewhere to do the record,’ says Matt Helders about the decision to record in LA; ‘we knew we wanted to go somewhere and do it and it were gray and horrible here’. Alex: ‘We were there for five weeks, a good stretch. But it were different to the last album when we went out to the desert and it was re-ally all about that experience and feeling far away’.  \n<br /><br />\n‘We were looking at places to record and that one seemed to tick all the boxes. The studio we were in (Sound City) there’s been some greats… there’s a really good drum room, that was a big draw, it’s where they did “Nevermind” [Nir-vana].’ ‘They were all saying it’s the best drum room in the world,’ adds Matt, ‘so it was a bit of pressure, no excuse to fuck it up!!  Laughter better play something good then!’\n<br /><br />\nFor “Suck It and See” the Monkeys changed the way they work, as Alex ex-plains: ‘the plan this time was to get the songs together early on and have them be the guide. In the past perhaps it’s come from a riff or like different drum parts kicking around and then we’d piece it together. This time we’ve thought a lot more about what each finished song required in terms of its musical parts and the best way to realise it. We have done a little bit of that before but perhaps not as much as on this one.’\n<br /><br />\nSuiting the album’s pop approach, “Suck It and See” is much more arranged than the last album, “Humbug”, with Jamie Cook’s guitar a particular revela-tion: adding flavour, excitement and a variety of textures in short bursts. Alex: ‘I suppose just that it was a decision to try and make things as simple as pos-sible, to get the sounds together and then try and do as little as we could and leave quite a lot of space and not do a lot of overdubs and organs’.\n<br /><br />\nMatt:  ‘We cut live and recorded – no cheating!’\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘Not fix anything, we spent all the time rehearsing so that we could play them well enough to not keep going through and fixing the tapes.  And even if there is a little bit in there we just left it’.\n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘Once you start fixing things you can get too obsessive as well, every little thing.  Once you know you can easily sort it out with a computer the temptation is there. Even if you know you’ve done something wrong you know you can sort it out which a lot of people must do nowadays, Yeah everything’s perfect; ironed out’.\n<br /><br />\nThe album’s twelve songs vary in pace and texture, with Alex Turner’s vocals taking a more sophisticated, smoother approach – no less humorous or blunt, but a different pitch, more insinuating. ‘It’s kind of got lower as times go on,’ he reflects about his voice. ‘I think a lot of these ones I wrote at home on an acoustic guitar sort of sitting and when I do that I tend to sing softly and qui-etly and low and usually too low’.  \n<br /><br />\n‘So when we get it in with the band we have to move it up a couple of tones to get it to sit right.  That’s something we never really looked at before like the key – getting the right key for things – cos we you used to get in and bash things out and it would take you too long to change the key so you’d just fuck-ing leave it Laughter but yeah that’s where I’m comfortable now singing in, there’s a bit more space I suppose, its not quite as rapid as it used to be’.\n<br /><br />\n‘We had a discussion before we began, about what we wanted this to be this time and one thing we all agreed were we wanted to get really good songs ar-ranged and then hopefully the rest you can work out without the initial tunes there otherwise you might run into trouble.  So I think that just meant me try-ing to listen to good song writers which I suppose meant listening to a bit of John Cale, I got into him a lot over the last years, and the Velvet Underground as well but his solo records like “Fear”.’ \n<br /><br />\n‘And I started getting into Country music which is something I’ve never gone anywhere near until quite recently, like I never understood it before. I know I’m never going to write a country tune, laughter, that just wouldn’t work but for that reason I can draw something from it. They’re really sort of smart arses sometimes those guys, like George Jones and that kind of thing. The sound doesn’t speak to me but the lyrics do’. \n<br /><br />\n“Suck It and See” is full of songs that chart the twists and turns of sex and love with elemental imagery, sharp lyrics and great pop-cultural metaphors – with references to past rock’n roll classics (‘you look like you’ve been for breakfast at the Heartbreak Hotel’) different kinds of soft drinks (Dandelion and Bur-dock, Postmix Lemonade) and arcane 21st century leisure pursuits (Laser-quest).\n<br /><br />\n‘I were thinking about this yesterday,’ says Alex about the wide open weather imagery of “Thunderstorm” and “Black Treacle”, ‘and the reason for this may-be could be, I realised this is the first time I’ve written not on the ground floor. Because I wrote most of the album in New York in the flat on the 4th floor so…’ \n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘it’s being closer to the sky’. \n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘yeah looking out of the window and there being a lot more sky…’\n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘’like Australia – the sky’s further away…’\n<br /><br />\nLaughter\n<br /><br />\nFor fans of Turner’s lyrics, there are some classic lines: ‘trust some ellipses to chase you round the room’ (“Library Pictures”); ‘the type of kiss where teeth collide’ (“Reckless Serenade”); ‘I’m sure you’re still breaking hearts with all the efficiency that only youth can harness’ (“Laserquest”). \n<br /><br />\nOne of the best lines comes in the title track “Suck It and See”: ‘I poured my aching heart into a pop song, I couldn’t get the hang of poetry’. How much are these lyrics autobiographical? ‘It’s not accurate at all, Alex admits.  ‘Because I think that’s something that I have done before and like I used to really write about exactly the situation that happened and after a while I sort of wished I hadn’t.’\n<br /><br />\n‘And I don’t know if it is harder for everyone else to enjoy then as well if it’s your thing.  I’m more into making songs the best they can be and I think to do that you don’t want to put too much of yourself but I think you have to do a bit because it can go too much the other way.  That’s something I’ve done as well. And with poetry I feel like it’s just like a couple of leagues up, you’re not hid-ing behind a melody’. \n<br /><br />\nThe album also contains several great rockers (“Library Pictures”) but two in particular stand out. The first, “Brick by Brick” has a killer riff and Matt Held-ers on his first full band vocal: ‘it was very enjoyable’, he says. The track origi-nated in a band catch-phrase. Alex: ‘we got off a long flight once and we were in Miami, we were sort of sitting around in the bar and had an idea for a song called “Brick by Brick” and we kind of just wrote it through that night’.\n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘it were like an ongoing thing for a long time…’\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘a few weeks yeah’.\n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘different lines, there were probably a thousand options, you could put anything in’.\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘whatever you want to do as long as it’s “Brick by Brick”, so we went through this and the list was probably three times as long as it ended up…’\n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘feed your child…’ laughs\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘we never like kind of wrote down what it were…’\n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘yeah even down to when it we were at the studio there were like slight changes…’ \n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘the only thing we knew we were going to have three “I wanna rock and roll”s, cos one rock and roll  is funny, two rock and rolls is a bit funnier but three is just fucking awesome!’\n<br /><br />\nOn the first single “Don’t Sit Down ‘Cause I’ve Moved Your Chair” the band itemise various things that you shouldn’t do: ‘wear your shell suit on bonfire night’, ‘do the Macarena in the devil’s lair’. Alex: ‘that song is an idea rather than you sort of sitting down and writing a letter or something. There’s a few we’ve had like that before and this is definitely one of them. “Brick by Brick” is very much an idea. You think we’re going to have a song and then you just make a list of things and that list will be too long at first and then you shorten it down’.\n<br /><br />\n‘But yeah “Don’t Sit Down ‘Cause…” was that somebody said that once.  I was in the studio with James Ford and the engineer or whatever, I pinched his seat and he was fiddling around plugging something in and I said “don’t sit down because I’ve moved your chair” and James started laughing and said “that sounds like it would be a 60s garage tune or something like that”, laughter and then he said “you should write that”.’  \n<br /><br />\n‘So then I thought if you can’t sit down because I’ve moved your chair what list of ridiculous things can you do that are like more dangerous or risky, cos like sitting down would be dangerous, that’s what we’re really focusing on, we re-ally don’t want him to sit down but he can do whatever else he likes’.\n<br /><br />\nLet’s go back to those soft-drink references on the anthemic title track, “Suck It and See”….\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘Dandelion & Burdock is a rare fizzy drink, English I think.’\n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘yeah probably not even so much down in London I don’t think.  I was watching Saturday Kitchen one week and he used it in a recipe and he’s from Leeds or whatever and Louise Redknapp had never heard of it before she were like ‘what’s this…’\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘Apparently John Paul Jones really likes it as well….’\n<br /><br />\nLaughter\n<br /><br />\nMatt: It’s good, I should incorporate it into drinking vodka. I do have them quite regularly because well I know where to get them laughs like its always in chip shops. It’s really quite sweet’.\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘and then postmix lemonade you have a lot more often so I thought that would be quite a good analogy to compliment a woman laughter if she’s … \n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘one of a kind…’\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘yeah ‘you’re rare’ … and doing that with a fizzy drink seemed quite fun-ny’.\n<br /><br />\nArctic Monkeys are Jamie Cook, Matt Helders, Nick O’Malley and Alex Turner. “Suck It and See” is their fourth album. It contains twelve songs, in-cluding a reworking of “Piledriver Waltz” from the Turner written soundtrack to Richard Ayoade’s film “Submarine” (also released on Domino).

A reference to last album “Humbug”, or what?\n<br /><br />\nAlex: I guess it is in a way but we struggle with putting a title on a record and have done every time and I dunno… To be honest we just thought that, out of all of the song titles, that was the one that made most sense. That’s quite a nice phrase, it’s an old British phrase.’ \n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘It’s a bit “Carry On”….’","hometown":"Sheffield","link":"http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/band/arctic-monkeys","itunes_link":null,"alt_description":"Light and airy, filmic but intimate, carefully arranged but deceptively power-ful, “Suck It and See” is Arctic Monkeys’ fourth album. Recorded at Sound City Studios in Los Angeles with long-time producer/ collaborator James Ford, it has a summery pop feel: with the bulk of work completed on the West Coast during January, it’s got the feel-good sound of stealing some winter sun, some out of season Vitamin D.\n<br /><br />\n‘Everyone was in a really good mood when we were there,’ says Alex Turner; ‘so I think the fact we were having a laugh comes across. When I’ve played it to friends they’ve said “it sounds like you’re having a really good time”, I think we wanted it to sound quite fun and up, not too serious’. \n<br /><br />\n‘It were more about making it more of a trip and an experience I suppose, going somewhere to do the record,’ says Matt Helders about the decision to record in LA; ‘we knew we wanted to go somewhere and do it and it were gray and horrible here’. Alex: ‘We were there for five weeks, a good stretch. But it were different to the last album when we went out to the desert and it was re-ally all about that experience and feeling far away’.  \n<br /><br />\n‘We were looking at places to record and that one seemed to tick all the boxes. The studio we were in (Sound City) there’s been some greats… there’s a really good drum room, that was a big draw, it’s where they did “Nevermind” [Nir-vana].’ ‘They were all saying it’s the best drum room in the world,’ adds Matt, ‘so it was a bit of pressure, no excuse to fuck it up!!  Laughter better play something good then!’\n<br /><br />\nFor “Suck It and See” the Monkeys changed the way they work, as Alex ex-plains: ‘the plan this time was to get the songs together early on and have them be the guide. In the past perhaps it’s come from a riff or like different drum parts kicking around and then we’d piece it together. This time we’ve thought a lot more about what each finished song required in terms of its musical parts and the best way to realise it. We have done a little bit of that before but perhaps not as much as on this one.’\n<br /><br />\nSuiting the album’s pop approach, “Suck It and See” is much more arranged than the last album, “Humbug”, with Jamie Cook’s guitar a particular revela-tion: adding flavour, excitement and a variety of textures in short bursts. Alex: ‘I suppose just that it was a decision to try and make things as simple as pos-sible, to get the sounds together and then try and do as little as we could and leave quite a lot of space and not do a lot of overdubs and organs’.\n<br /><br />\nMatt:  ‘We cut live and recorded – no cheating!’\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘Not fix anything, we spent all the time rehearsing so that we could play them well enough to not keep going through and fixing the tapes.  And even if there is a little bit in there we just left it’.\n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘Once you start fixing things you can get too obsessive as well, every little thing.  Once you know you can easily sort it out with a computer the temptation is there. Even if you know you’ve done something wrong you know you can sort it out which a lot of people must do nowadays, Yeah everything’s perfect; ironed out’.\n<br /><br />\nThe album’s twelve songs vary in pace and texture, with Alex Turner’s vocals taking a more sophisticated, smoother approach – no less humorous or blunt, but a different pitch, more insinuating. ‘It’s kind of got lower as times go on,’ he reflects about his voice. ‘I think a lot of these ones I wrote at home on an acoustic guitar sort of sitting and when I do that I tend to sing softly and qui-etly and low and usually too low’.  \n<br /><br />\n‘So when we get it in with the band we have to move it up a couple of tones to get it to sit right.  That’s something we never really looked at before like the key – getting the right key for things – cos we you used to get in and bash things out and it would take you too long to change the key so you’d just fuck-ing leave it Laughter but yeah that’s where I’m comfortable now singing in, there’s a bit more space I suppose, its not quite as rapid as it used to be’.\n<br /><br />\n‘We had a discussion before we began, about what we wanted this to be this time and one thing we all agreed were we wanted to get really good songs ar-ranged and then hopefully the rest you can work out without the initial tunes there otherwise you might run into trouble.  So I think that just meant me try-ing to listen to good song writers which I suppose meant listening to a bit of John Cale, I got into him a lot over the last years, and the Velvet Underground as well but his solo records like “Fear”.’ \n<br /><br />\n‘And I started getting into Country music which is something I’ve never gone anywhere near until quite recently, like I never understood it before. I know I’m never going to write a country tune, laughter, that just wouldn’t work but for that reason I can draw something from it. They’re really sort of smart arses sometimes those guys, like George Jones and that kind of thing. The sound doesn’t speak to me but the lyrics do’. \n<br /><br />\n“Suck It and See” is full of songs that chart the twists and turns of sex and love with elemental imagery, sharp lyrics and great pop-cultural metaphors – with references to past rock’n roll classics (‘you look like you’ve been for breakfast at the Heartbreak Hotel’) different kinds of soft drinks (Dandelion and Bur-dock, Postmix Lemonade) and arcane 21st century leisure pursuits (Laser-quest).\n<br /><br />\n‘I were thinking about this yesterday,’ says Alex about the wide open weather imagery of “Thunderstorm” and “Black Treacle”, ‘and the reason for this may-be could be, I realised this is the first time I’ve written not on the ground floor. Because I wrote most of the album in New York in the flat on the 4th floor so…’ \n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘it’s being closer to the sky’. \n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘yeah looking out of the window and there being a lot more sky…’\n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘’like Australia – the sky’s further away…’\n<br /><br />\nLaughter\n<br /><br />\nFor fans of Turner’s lyrics, there are some classic lines: ‘trust some ellipses to chase you round the room’ (“Library Pictures”); ‘the type of kiss where teeth collide’ (“Reckless Serenade”); ‘I’m sure you’re still breaking hearts with all the efficiency that only youth can harness’ (“Laserquest”). \n<br /><br />\nOne of the best lines comes in the title track “Suck It and See”: ‘I poured my aching heart into a pop song, I couldn’t get the hang of poetry’. How much are these lyrics autobiographical? ‘It’s not accurate at all, Alex admits.  ‘Because I think that’s something that I have done before and like I used to really write about exactly the situation that happened and after a while I sort of wished I hadn’t.’\n<br /><br />\n‘And I don’t know if it is harder for everyone else to enjoy then as well if it’s your thing.  I’m more into making songs the best they can be and I think to do that you don’t want to put too much of yourself but I think you have to do a bit because it can go too much the other way.  That’s something I’ve done as well. And with poetry I feel like it’s just like a couple of leagues up, you’re not hid-ing behind a melody’. \n<br /><br />\nThe album also contains several great rockers (“Library Pictures”) but two in particular stand out. The first, “Brick by Brick” has a killer riff and Matt Held-ers on his first full band vocal: ‘it was very enjoyable’, he says. The track origi-nated in a band catch-phrase. Alex: ‘we got off a long flight once and we were in Miami, we were sort of sitting around in the bar and had an idea for a song called “Brick by Brick” and we kind of just wrote it through that night’.\n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘it were like an ongoing thing for a long time…’\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘a few weeks yeah’.\n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘different lines, there were probably a thousand options, you could put anything in’.\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘whatever you want to do as long as it’s “Brick by Brick”, so we went through this and the list was probably three times as long as it ended up…’\n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘feed your child…’ laughs\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘we never like kind of wrote down what it were…’\n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘yeah even down to when it we were at the studio there were like slight changes…’ \n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘the only thing we knew we were going to have three “I wanna rock and roll”s, cos one rock and roll  is funny, two rock and rolls is a bit funnier but three is just fucking awesome!’\n<br /><br />\nOn the first single “Don’t Sit Down ‘Cause I’ve Moved Your Chair” the band itemise various things that you shouldn’t do: ‘wear your shell suit on bonfire night’, ‘do the Macarena in the devil’s lair’. Alex: ‘that song is an idea rather than you sort of sitting down and writing a letter or something. There’s a few we’ve had like that before and this is definitely one of them. “Brick by Brick” is very much an idea. You think we’re going to have a song and then you just make a list of things and that list will be too long at first and then you shorten it down’.\n<br /><br />\n‘But yeah “Don’t Sit Down ‘Cause…” was that somebody said that once.  I was in the studio with James Ford and the engineer or whatever, I pinched his seat and he was fiddling around plugging something in and I said “don’t sit down because I’ve moved your chair” and James started laughing and said “that sounds like it would be a 60s garage tune or something like that”, laughter and then he said “you should write that”.’  \n<br /><br />\n‘So then I thought if you can’t sit down because I’ve moved your chair what list of ridiculous things can you do that are like more dangerous or risky, cos like sitting down would be dangerous, that’s what we’re really focusing on, we re-ally don’t want him to sit down but he can do whatever else he likes’.\n<br /><br />\nLet’s go back to those soft-drink references on the anthemic title track, “Suck It and See”….\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘Dandelion & Burdock is a rare fizzy drink, English I think.’\n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘yeah probably not even so much down in London I don’t think.  I was watching Saturday Kitchen one week and he used it in a recipe and he’s from Leeds or whatever and Louise Redknapp had never heard of it before she were like ‘what’s this…’\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘Apparently John Paul Jones really likes it as well….’\n<br /><br />\nLaughter\n<br /><br />\nMatt: It’s good, I should incorporate it into drinking vodka. I do have them quite regularly because well I know where to get them laughs like its always in chip shops. It’s really quite sweet’.\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘and then postmix lemonade you have a lot more often so I thought that would be quite a good analogy to compliment a woman laughter if she’s … \n<br /><br />\nMatt: ‘one of a kind…’\n<br /><br />\nAlex: ‘yeah ‘you’re rare’ … and doing that with a fizzy drink seemed quite fun-ny’.\n<br /><br />\nArctic Monkeys are Jamie Cook, Matt Helders, Nick O’Malley and Alex Turner. “Suck It and See” is their fourth album. It contains twelve songs, in-cluding a reworking of “Piledriver Waltz” from the Turner written soundtrack to Richard Ayoade’s film “Submarine” (also released on Domino).
